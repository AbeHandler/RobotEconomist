## Annotation

Hereâ€™s an issue. We need to be more precise about what we mean by setting. Is it a it a place? Europe, India,. What about time. Decade? Century? Sector?

#### Some notes on token-level annotation:

Another option might be to automatically tag NPs in the corpus and ask people about particular spans. So like pre define the possible spans that the economist can choose.
