### Must haves

- Well it needs to handle cases where it can't find the variable. Right now it errors and dies
- **Would be nice if it could summarize some of those papers for you a little bit as well, maybe with a -s flag?**
- Just abstracts mode.
- Semantic similarity module? Like if you search for rain do we need to connect it to weather? How important is that?
- All the causal paths?
- What if it is cyclical? No cycles in the output?

### Nice to haves
- To show this to some, you would need a Web app. You can get on with it from Fiver?
- What do I need to control for? That part is not super hard. One question is how sure do you want to be?
- Expand the set of things we are looking for?
- What to control for?
- use naveen pipecleaner on the NBER to find and check missing files you cant process

### How wrong is this?
- Null effects
- This is other people's work


### Engineering?
- I think we need a model/view/controller?
