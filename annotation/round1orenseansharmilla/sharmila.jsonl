{"id":"Acharya 2016b.json","text":"We show that contemporary differences in political attitudes across counties in the American South in part trace their origins to slavery's prevalence more than 150 years ago. Whites who currently live in Southern counties that had high shares of slaves in 1860 are more likely to identify as a Republican, oppose affirmative action, and express racial resentment and colder feelings toward blacks. We show that these results cannot be explained by existing theories, including the theory of contemporary racial threat. To explain the results, we offer evidence for a new theory involving the historical persistence of political attitudes. Following the Civil War, Southern whites faced political and economic incentives to reinforce existing racist norms and institutions to maintain control over the newly freed African American population. This amplified local differences in racially conservative political attitudes, which in turn have been passed down locally across generations.","entities":[],"relations":[]}

Unfortunately, this common approach may lead to biased estimates. In this article, we show that the bias can be avoided by focusing on a quantity of interest called the controlled direct effect. Under certain conditions, the controlled direct effect enables researchers to rule out competing explanations-an important objective for political scientists. To estimate the controlled direct effect without bias, we describe an easy-to-implement estimation strategy from the biostatistics literature. We extend this approach by deriving a consistent variance estimator and demonstrating how to conduct a sensitivity analysis. Two examples-one on ethnic fractionalization's effect on civil war and one on the impact of historical plough use on contemporary female political participation-illustrate the framework and methodology.","entities":[],"relations":[]}

By using the Two Stage Least Squares Instrumental Variable (2SLS-IV) estimator, it is found that a fall in rainfall-driven agricultural income leads to a decrease in per capita expenditure. The results show that the gender and the locality of the household head matter in the response of per capita expenditures to rainfall-driven agricultural income. Female-headed and rural households are more vulnerable to rainfall-driven agricultural income changes.

These results are typically presented in the context of linear models with fixed coefficients and additive residuals. The first contribution of this paper is an investigation of the consequences of relaxing both the linearity and the additivity assumption for the interpretation of linear instrumental variables estimators. Without these assumptions, the standard linear instrumental variables estimator identifies a weighted average of the derivative of the behavioural relationship of interest. A second contribution is the formulation of critical identifying assumptions in terms of demand and supply at different prices and instruments, rather than in terms of functional-form specific residuals. Our approach to the simultaneous equations problem and the average-derivative interpretation of instrumental variables estimates is illustrated by estimating the demand for fresh whiting at the Fulton fish market. Strong and credible instruments for identification of this demand function are available in the form of weather conditions at sea.","entities":[{"id":1212,"label":"instrument","start_offset":534,"end_offset":545}],"relations":[]}

We identify the main drivers and impacts of crop and labor diversification which constitute two livelihood strategies on moderating the adaptation deficit. In doing so, we account for the interdependence between the two diversification practices and potential reverse causality between welfare outcomes and diversification behavior. Moreover, we condition the impacts of diversification on different sections of the welfare distribution to capture potential non-linear effects. Our results reveal that the diversification has positive and significant welfare impacts when most vulnerable households rely on it as an adaptation strategy to mid-run climate variability and as a coping strategy to short-run market shocks. At the same time, our results find lower but still positive impacts for well-endowed households that are likely to diversify their activity portfolio. Given the very limited presence of policy support, we conclude that the rural Nigerien communities are characterized by a large and autonomous adaptation response which constitutes a key leverage mechanism for policy makers. We thus suggest government interventions aimed at supporting the most important diversification drivers, but also aimed at straightening some channels, such as network infrastructures or the promotion of local crop varieties, which may have a greater potential in triggering diversification.","entities":[{"id":1675,"label":"variable","start_offset":715,"end_offset":730},{"id":1676,"label":"variable","start_offset":760,"end_offset":767}],"relations":[{"id":522,"from_id":1675,"to_id":1676,"type":"affects"}]}

The aim of the present analysis was to examine the C-R curve between O 3 concentration and mortality with a causal framework approach. Methods: We extracted data of hourly meteorology, hourly O 3 concentration and daily non-accidental mortality in Seoul from 2001 to 2009. We divided the dataset into two, odd-number (training set) and even-number years (testing set). Using the training set, we constructed a prediction model from hourly O 3 concentration with support vector regression estimating the daily variations of mean O 3 concentration caused by sun irradiation, wind speed and direction, controlling temperature, barometric pressure and temporal trend. With this model we predicted variance of daily O 3 from the testing set, thus creating an instrumental variable. We analyzed the association between the instrumental variable and daily mortality. We also analyzed the association according to the quartiles of daily mean O 3 concentration to examine the linearity of the association. Results: The instrumental variable was significantly and negatively associated with daily mortality in the linear model. In the stratified analysis, the negative slope was observed in the lowest quartile and the negative slope of the association diminished as the quartile increased, and the slope became positive over the 3rd quartile (O 3 > 23.3 ppb). The interaction between quartiles and instrumental variable was significant (P = 0.0108).We observed unequal effect of exposure to ambient O 3 concentration on mortality according to the different ranges of daily mean O 3 concentration with a causal framework approach.","entities":[],"relations":[]}

{"id":"Bartels.json","text":"The trade-off between the efficiency of an instrumental variable and its exogeneity is widely recognized but little understood. This paper specifies the terms of that trade-off by analyzing the asymptotic mean squared errors associated with the instrumental variables estimator when the instrument may not be perfectly exogenous. The analysis shows that even seemingly minor misspecifications can play havoc with statistical inferences based on \"quasi-instrumental variable\" estimators.Simple rules of thumb are derived by which intuition can be applied to choices among alternative estimators based on different instrumental variables, or between instrumental variable and ordinary least squares estimators. The theoretical analysis is applied to an example drawn from Jacobson's (1990) and Green and Krasno's (1990) work on congressional campaign spending and is bolstered by Monte Carlo simulations that, for the most part, reproduce the patterns of errors predicted by the asymptotic results.It is common in textbook treatments of the instrumental variables estimator to remark upon the difficulty of knowing or demonstrating that a potential instrument is itself really exogenous. Thus, Johnston (1972, wrote that \"the real difficulty in practice of course is actually finding variables to play the role of instruments. The true disturbance is unobservable and so it is difficult to be confident that the instruments really are uncorrelated in the limit with the disturbances.\" In view of this very real difficulty, it is remarkable that these same textbooks and the econometric literature more generally devote little or no attention to the practical consequences of using \"instruments\" that are really only approximately exogenous.It is obvious that a \"quasi-instrumental variable\" estimator one based on an instrumental variable that is only approximately uncorrelated with the disturbance will not produce consistent estimates of the underlying parameters of interest. However, it should also be obvious that the use of such a quasiinstrumental variable may often be unavoidable in applied work. Moreover, even when a genuine (perfectly exogenous) instrument is available, it may be so inefficient that a quasi-instrumental variables estimator is preferable in practice (e.g., by a squared error criterion) because data are in short supply.","entities":[],"relations":[]}

In contrast, findings from psychological research suggest that victimization increases apathy due to loss of self-esteem and social cohesion.

{"id":"Bertelli.json","text":"Despite the worldwide decrease in fertility rates, Sub-Saharan Africa is still an exception, showing an almost non-declining trend over the past 50 years. In a high child mortality context parents might prefer a larger number of children, anticipating the risk of child mortality. This paper tests the short-term impact of an exogenous decrease in child mortality on household fertility. By exploiting positive exogenous weather shocks together with household panel data, I find that abundant rainfall increases child survival in the Nigerian context. Large households are the ones who benefit the most from this, and they are also the ones who respond by decreasing their fertility the most. Conversely, small households only slightly benefit from a decrease in child mortality and they continue to increase their birth rate. For a household with the average number of three children, mortality decreases by 0.013 while fertility increases by 0.046 children. When positive shocks occur, households get on average larger, as more children survive and parents only partially reduce their fertility. Consistent with such partial adjustment, household food security and children's anthropometric measures deteriorate. This matches the predictions of the theoretical framework, which shows that the magnitude of the fertility adjustment depends on the number of children alive at the moment of the shock. The empirical analysis tests this prediction, by using the gender of the first-born as instrument for the initial number of children.","entities":[{"id":1684,"label":"variable","start_offset":493,"end_offset":501},{"id":1685,"label":"variable","start_offset":511,"end_offset":525}],"relations":[{"id":527,"from_id":1684,"to_id":1685,"type":"affects"}]}

We show that ignoring spatial interdependence in the outcome results in asymptotically biased estimates even when instruments are randomly assigned. The extent of this bias increases when the instrument is also spatially clustered, as is the case for many widely used instruments: rainfall, natural disasters, economic shocks, and regionally-or globally-weighted averages. Because the biases due to spatial interdependence and predictor endogeneity can offset, addressing only one can increase the bias relative to ordinary least squares. We demonstrate the extent of these biases both analytically and via Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, we discuss a general estimation strategy -S-2SLSthat accounts for both outcome interdependence and predictor endogeneity, thereby recovering consistent estimates of predictor effects.As political scientists increasingly focus on the identification of causal effects, instrumental variable (IV) models are becoming commonplace (e.g., Sovey and Green, 2011).

While researchers are usually aware of conditional independence and relevance as general requirements for valid instruments, we identify a specific threat that is frequently ignored: spatial interdependence in the outcome variable.

{"id":"Cachon.json","text":"What is the relationship between inventory and sales? Clearly, inventory could increase sales: expanding inventory creates more choice (options, colors, etc.) and might signal a popular\/desirable product. Or, inventory might encourage a consumer to continue her search (e.g., on the theory that she can return if nothing better is found), thereby decreasing sales (a scarcity effect). We seek to identify these effects in U.S. automobile sales. Our primary research challenge is the endogenous relationship between inventory and sales-e.g., dealers influence their inventory in anticipation of demand. Hence, our estimation strategy relies on weather shocks at upstream production facilities to create exogenous variation in downstream dealership inventory. We find that the impact of adding a vehicle of a particular model to a dealer's lot depends on which cars the dealer already has. If the added vehicle expands the available set of submodels (e.g., adding a four-door among a set that is exclusively two-door), then sales increase. But if the added vehicle is of the same submodel as an existing vehicle, then sales actually decrease. Hence, expanding variety across submodels should be the first priority when adding inventoryadding inventory within a submodel is actually detrimental. In fact, given how vehicles were allocated to dealerships in practice, we find that adding inventory actually lowered sales. However, our data indicate that there could be a substantial benefit from the implementation of a \"maximize variety, minimize duplication\" allocation strategy: sales increase by 4.4% without changing the total number of vehicles at each dealership.","entities":[{"id":1701,"label":"variable","start_offset":1384,"end_offset":1393},{"id":1702,"label":"variable","start_offset":1411,"end_offset":1416}],"relations":[{"id":535,"from_id":1701,"to_id":1702,"type":"affects"}]}

Rice is the staple food in Indonesia and we investigate whether its scarcity can be blamed for fueling violence. Following insights from the natural science literature, which claims that increases in minimum temperature reduce rice yields, we maintain that increases in minimum temperature reduce food availability in many provinces, which in turn raises the emergence of actual violence. We adopt an instrumental variable approach and select the instruments taking into account the rice growing calendar. Results show that an increase of the minimum temperature during the core month of the rice growing season, that is, December, determines an increase in violence stimulated by the reduction in future rice production per capita.

I propose using randomization inference with historical weather patterns from 73 years as potential randomizations. I replicate the influential work on rainfall and voter turnout in presidential elections in the United States by Gomez, Hansford, and Krause (2007) and compare the estimated average treatment effect (ATE) to a sampling distribution of estimates under the sharp null hypothesis of no effect. The alternate randomizations are random draws from national rainfall patterns on election and would-be election days, which preserve the clustering in treatment assignment and eliminate the need to simulate weather patterns or make assumptions about unit boundaries for clustering.

The paper finds that, one, treating income as an exogenous variable underestimates the effect of income on the household's resource allocation. Two, there are more expenditure shares for which income is endogenous using the tropical cyclone data than using the heat index deviation data as instruments. This likely indicates that the households' unobservable characteristics like risk aversion is heightened for more destructive weather events. Three, households choose cheaper foods but just as nutritious when they are frequently hit by tropical cyclones. Reallocation of income within food items is also observed: from carbohydrate-rich foods to protein-rich foods and to fruits and vegetables. Four, the presence of children affects most of the food items and it has the biggest effect on non-alcoholic beverages such as juice and coffee while the presence of the elderly affects only a few expenditure items such as education and medical care. This reflects the still evolving needs of children and the relatively stable consumption patterns of the elderly. Based on the results, specific recommendations are forwarded. In broader terms, the study points to the desirability of greater forms of investment in resilience against weather events and climate change. At the household level, poverty is a binding constraint to good investment in resilience against weather events and the government has to continue its efforts towards poverty reduction.

Methods: We investigated power plants in the Eastern United States (US) that had production changes through unit shutdown or plant retirement between 1999 and 2013. We included only non-clustered power plants without scrubbers and with capacities greater than 50 MW. We used instrumental variable (IV) and difference-in-differences (DID) approaches to estimate the causal impact of PM 2.5 concentrations on mortality among Medicare beneficiaries. We compared changes in monthly age-adjusted mortality before and after the retirement of coal-fired plants between the treated and control counties; we accounted for annual wind direction in our selection of treated and control counties. In the models, we initially included only county and monthly fixed effects, and then adjusted for covariates including: 1) only weather variables (temperature, dew point, pressure); and 2) weather variables and socio-economic variables (median household income and poverty rate). Results: The monthly age-adjusted mortality rate averaged across all plants was approximately 423 per 100,000 (SD = 69) and was higher for males than females. Mean PM 2.5 concentrations across all counties were 12 μg\/m 3 (SD = 3.78). Using the IV method, we found that reductions in PM 2.5 concentrations significantly decreased monthly mortality among older adults. IV results show that a 1-μg\/m 3 reduction in PM 2.5 concentrations leads to 7.17 fewer deaths per 100,000 per month, or a 1.7% lower monthly mortality rate among people older than 65 years. Using the DID approach, we found that power plant retirement significantly decreased: 1) monthly PM 2.5 levels by 2.1 μg\/m 3 , and 2) monthly age-adjusted mortality by approximately 15 people per 100,000 (or 3.6%) in treated counties relative to control counties. The mortality effects were higher among males than females and its impact was the greatest among people older than 75 years. Conclusion: These findings provide evidence of the effectiveness of local, plant-level control measures in reducing near-plant PM 2.5 and mortality among U.S. Medicare beneficiaries.","entities":[{"id":1761,"label":"variable","start_offset":1587,"end_offset":1608},{"id":1764,"label":"variable","start_offset":1958,"end_offset":1971},{"id":1766,"label":"variable","start_offset":2325,"end_offset":2353},{"id":1767,"label":"variable","start_offset":2366,"end_offset":2383},{"id":1762,"label":"variable","start_offset":1641,"end_offset":1650},{"id":1763,"label":"variable","start_offset":1899,"end_offset":1921},{"id":1768,"label":"variable","start_offset":2388,"end_offset":2397}],"relations":[{"id":564,"from_id":1761,"to_id":1762,"type":"affects"},{"id":565,"from_id":1766,"to_id":1767,"type":"affects"},{"id":566,"from_id":1766,"to_id":1768,"type":"affects"}]}

First, when instruments sharing significant sources of variation are used to instrument multiple distinct covariates, it is increasingly likely the exclusion restriction was not satisfied in any individual specification from the outset. Second, when a variable is documented to affect many outcomes that are likely to be highly or even mildly persistent, using lagged values of that variable as an instrument is likely to violate the exclusion condition. This paper produces a dataset of approximately 960 instrumental variables papers from 1995-2019 in highly-ranked economics general interest and field journals. We find six groups of commonly-used instruments whose literatures, taken together, suggest they are likely to fail the strict exogeneity condition: (i) elevation and bodies of water (ii) sibling structure (iii) ethnicity\/ethnolinguistic fractionalization (iv) religion (v) weather and (vi) immigrant enclaves.

This finding renders it unlikely that extreme winters affect education through school closures during extreme climatic conditions, to which all children were exposed.

Precipitation anomaly in two climatological seasons is used as an instrument for poverty status, which is measured using per capita household consumption expenditure. Results of an instrumental variable estimation suggest that poverty causes poor mental health: halving one's consumption expenditure raises the probability of suffering mental illness by 0.06 point; in terms of elasticity, a 1% decrease in consumption brings about 0.62% more symptoms of common mental disorders. This poverty effect is approximately five times stronger than that obtained prior to instrumenting and is robust to alternative distributional assumption, model specification, sample stratification and estimation technique. An individual's mental health is also negatively correlated with district income inequality, suggesting that income distribution may have a significant influence upon mental health over and above the effect of poverty. The findings imply that mental health can be improved not only by influencing individuals' health knowledge and behaviour but also by implementing a more equitable economic policy.","entities":[{"id":1798,"label":"variable","start_offset":622,"end_offset":629},{"id":1799,"label":"variable","start_offset":642,"end_offset":655}],"relations":[{"id":585,"from_id":1798,"to_id":1799,"type":"affects"}]}

{"id":"Hendricks.json","text":"Crop yield shocks are partially predictable-high planting-time futures prices have tended to indicate that yield would be below trend. As a result, regressions of total caloric production on futures prices produce estimates of the supply elasticity that are biased downwards by up to 75%. Regressions of the world's growing area on futures prices have a much smaller bias of about 20% because although yield shocks are partially predictable, this predictability has a relatively small effect on land allocation. We argue that the preferred method for estimating the crop supply elasticity is to use regressions of growing area on futures prices and to include the realized yield shock as a control variable. An alternative method for bias reduction is to use instrumental variables (IVs).

The absence of financial markets is particularly severe in rural areas, where farmers face liquidity constraints and cannot insure against a bad harvest or loss of livestock. Whereas a bad harvest has immediate consequences for farmers' welfare, the consequences of loss of livestock are longer lasting. Without draft power from cattle, households can only produce using the hoe, which yields little income. Loss of livestock, therefore, leads a household to being stuck in poverty for a considerable period of time (see Carter and Zimmerman 2000).In the absence of formal financial institutions a large range of nonmarket solutions has become available to insure households against negative shocks and to allow them to smooth consumption over time. Examples of such nonmarket solutions are food-sharing arrangements in which a household confronted with a negative idiosyncratic shock gets food from other households and labor-sharing arrangements whereby other farmers take care of the land of someone who is temporarily unable to do so.

Utilizing housing transaction data in Sydney from 2000 to 2014, we find that transaction prices are significantly higher for auction sales compared with private sales, consistent with the notion of a \"winner's curse.\" Four sentiment proxies, including three weather-based sentiment proxies and a survey-based sentiment index, are used to derive novel measures of sentiment, revealing that higher sentiment is associated with higher transaction prices, particularly for auction sales. Moreover, sentiment boosts sale prices particularly when the housing market is in boom; however, investors are not more prone to sentiment bias than are owner-occupiers. Sentiment exhibits an asymmetric effect in that low sentiment dampens price to a greater extent compared with the price-boosting effect of high sentiment. Our result is robust to using national sport events as sentiment shocks, selection bias, and participation constraints. Potential mechanisms include present-biased preferences and sentiment-related projection bias.

Here, we highlight how the bias from weak instruments is amplified when instruments are not as-if randomly assigned. We demonstrate how using an IV estimator based on matching and randomization inference can both correct for departures from as-if random assignment and strengthen the instrument. Specifically, we combine a matching algorithm with a reverse caliper and penalties to strengthen the instrument within a subset of the overall study population.

Our empirical results demonstrate that there is a strongly non-linear link among electricity consumption, real income, electricity price, and temperature, a result that is new to the literature. As real income rises, electricity consumption rapidly increases first, and after the level of real income exceeds approximately US$2500, its increasing rate turns slow down. An increase in electricity price has a negative or no influence on electricity consumption. Evidence of a U-shaped relationship between electricity consumption and temperature is supported, and the threshold value of temperature is approximately 53 °F, which is endogenously determined. Furthermore, the estimated elasticities of time dynamic indicate that electricity demand is income inelastic, price inelastic, and temperature inelastic. As time goes on, the absolute elasticities of electricity demand gradually decrease with respect to real GDP and electricity price, whereas they gradually increase with respect to temperature, suggesting that the impact of temperature on electricity demand is becoming more important in recent years.","entities":[],"relations":[]}

Seasonally higher temperatures, solar radiation, humidity and anthropogenic pollution result in lower pH (acidification) in air, water and soil. Environmental acidification increases lead's bioavailability and mobility thus intensifying human, animal and plant exposures. In addition, lead seasonality in the biosphere is influenced by higher growth rates, slightly increased exposures, and more Vitamin D metabolism. Methodologically, we applied a One Health perspective to EPA's Integrated Science Assessments of Lead to review the published literature, supplemented with subsequent and related publications to assess data on the seasonality of lead exposure across species and through the earth's systems.

A strengthening of the right wing parties due to rainfall shifts expenditures toward education, but reduces total spending. This also shows that political competition does not drive party platforms to converge.☆ I am grateful for useful and constructive comments from two anonymous referees,","entities":[],"relations":[]}
{"id":"Liu.json","text":"We combine COVID-19 case data with mobility data to estimate a modified susceptible-infectedrecovered (SIR) model in the United States. In contrast to a standard SIR model, we find that the incidence of COVID-19 spread is concave in the number of infectious individuals, as would be expected if people have inter-related social networks. This concave shape has a significant impact on forecasted COVID-19 cases. In particular, our model forecasts that the number of COVID-19 cases would only have an exponential growth for a brief period at the beginning of the contagion event or right after a reopening, but would quickly settle into a prolonged period of time with stable, slightly declining levels of disease spread. This pattern is consistent with observed levels of COVID-19 cases in the US, but inconsistent with standard SIR modeling. We forecast rates of new cases for COVID-19 under different social distancing norms and find that if social distancing is eliminated there will be a massive increase in the cases of COVID-19.The COVID-19 pandemic has caused great disruption. Over 43 million people have confirmed diagnoses of the disease, and over 1 million people have died from it 1 . It has also had substantial impacts on daily lives and economic activities 2,3 . Many studies have focused on measuring who are affected the most by COVID-19 4,5 , or which therapies are appropriate at each stage of the disease 6-8 . However, it is also crucial to understand how the spread of COVID-19 depends on preventive measures such as social distancing and how the reopening may affect the spread.The most common model used to study the spread of COVID-19 is the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model. In such models, there is a susceptible population, which is assumed to be equal to the population of whichever region is being examined minus the number of people that have previously had the disease. Some of the susceptible individuals get infected in each period, where the rate of infection is a function of the number of infectious individuals as well as other factors that shift the rate of transmission. Finally, infectious individuals move to a state of recovery. In our analysis, we call anyone who was sick but is no longer infectious to be \"recovered, \" although some of these people may still actually be sick, hospitalized, or have died. Thus, the recovered terminology is actually a shorthand for all post-infectious states. This model, and its variants, have been used extensively to study the growth of COVID-19. For example, a recent study estimates a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Confirmed-Removed (SEIQR) model, which appends the standard SIR model with a stage modeling susceptible people who become exposed to the virus and a stage modeling infected people which are confirmed to have the disease 9 . The paper then applies this model to estimate COVID-19 transmission in Wuhan, China, showing that an earlier lockdown makes the outbreak worse in Wuhan but helps the rest of the world. The SEIQR model is also used to show that travel restrictions may have reduced the spread of COVID-19 from Wuhan, China, to other Chinese cities 10,11 . As another variant to the SIR model, the SEIR model (adding an exposure stage to the SIR model) is also applied to compute the rate of transmission both from animals to people and from people to people 12 . While it may seem that having more stages in the model would make the SEIR model superior to the SIR model, it has been shown that the standard SIR model does a better job at predicting the spread of COVID-19, based on data from Wuhan, China 13 .In this paper, we use a modified version of the SIR model to measure the extent to which social distancing reduces the speed at which COVID-19 spreads. We then run simulations to forecast the rates of COVID-19 spread under different social distancing levels during the reopening. We find that COVID-19 spreads less than proportionately with the number of infectious individuals, a distinct difference from the assumption of standard models. We demonstrate that this pattern could be explained by the interconnectedness of people's social networks. This pattern suggests that each additional infectious individual has less impact on the disease spread","entities":[],"relations":[]}

We show that good weather at this initial, coordinating event had significant consequences for the subsequent local strength of the movement, increased public support for Tea Party positions, and led to more Republican votes in the 2010 midterm elections. Policymaking was also affected, as incumbents responded to large protests in their district by voting more conservatively in Congress. Our estimates suggest significant multiplier effects: an additional protester increased the number of Republican votes by a factor well above one.

In this paper, I estimate the external return to education by comparing wages for otherwise similar individuals who work in cities with higher and lower average levels of education. A key issue in this comparison is the presence of unobservable factors that may raise wages and attract more highly educated workers to different cities. I use changes in wages across the 1980 and 1990 Censuses to abstract from any permanent sources of unobserved heterogeneity across cities. To further control for the potential endogeneity of the growth in education across cities, I use an instrumental variable scheme motivated by the observation that younger cohorts have higher education than older cohorts. Specifically, I use the demographic structure of different cities in 1970 as an instrument for changes in education over the 1980s. The results suggest that a 1% increase in the share of college educated workers raises high-school drop-outs wages by 2.2%, high-school graduates wages by 1.3%, the wage of workers with some college by 1.2% and those of college graduates by 1.1%. Consistent with a model that includes both conventional demand and supply factors and externalities, a rise in the portion of better-educated workers has a larger positive effect on less-educated workers.

The trials were ubiquitous: conducted by both ecclesiastical and secular courts; by both Catholics and Protestants. The victims were primarily women, primarily poor and disproportionately widows. The persecutions took place throughout Europe, starting and ending earlier in southwest Europe than in the northern and eastern areas, and spread even across the Atlantic Ocean to Salem, Massachusetts.

Extreme rainfall, both droughts and floods, lead to a large increase in property crimes (such as robbery, petty theft, and cattle raiding), but not to an increase in interpersonal violent crimes (such as murder, homicides, and assault).

However, linkages between the markets for soy oil and palm oil, which is associated with very high land use change emissions, could negatively affect the climate performance of soy-based biofuels. This study estimates the own and cross-price elasticities for the supply of soy and palm oils in the US using country-level data from 1992 to 2016 under rational expectations, through a seemingly unrelated regressions system of equations. We find a positive crossprice elasticity of palm oil import with respect to soy oil price and a positive reaction of supply of soy oil to increase in prices of palm oil. These results suggest that US biofuel policies may underestimate substitution between soy and palm oils and thus overestimate the climate benefits from soy-based biofuel.","entities":[],"relations":[]}

The literature demonstrating this relationship uses rainfall shocks to instrument for income shocks, arguing that in agriculturallydependent regions, negative rain shocks lower income which incites violence. This identification strategy relies on the assumption that rainfall shocks affect conflict only through their impacts on income. This paper evaluates this exclusion restriction in the context of religious conflict in India. Using data on dam construction, I identify districts that are downstream from irrigation dams and show that income in these areas is much less sensitive to rainfall fluctuations. However, rain shocks remain equally strong predictors of riot incidence in these districts. I explore other channels through which rainfall might affect conflict.","entities":[],"relations":[]}

This effect is both cross-sectional-countries with higher average conflict risk tend to have poorer coverage-and cross-temporal-civil conflict leads to loss of weather stations. Poor coverage induces a small downward bias in one widely used temperature data set, due to its interpolation method, and increases measurement error, potentially attenuating estimates of the temperature-conflict relationship. Combining multiple observational data sets to reduce measurement error almost doubles the estimated effect of temperature anomalies on civil conflict risk.","entities":[],"relations":[]}
{"id":"Shen.json","text":"The COVID-19 has caused more than three million infections and over two hundred thousand deaths by April 2020 1 . Limiting socioeconomic activities (SA) is among the most adopted governmental mitigating efforts to combat the transmission of the virus, though the degree varies dramatically among different regimes 2 . This study aims to quantify the contribution from the SA and weather conditions to the transmission of COVID-19 at global scale. Ruling out the unobservable factors including medical facilities and other control policies (MOC) through region-by-time fixed effects 3,4 , we show that the limiting SA has a leading contribution to lower the reproductive number by 18.3%, while weather conditions, including ultraviolet, relative humidity, and wind explain a smaller amount of variation. Temperature might have a non-monotonic impact on the transmission. We further show that in developed countries 5 and China, the SA effect is more pronounced whereas the weather effect is significantly downplayed possibly because people tend to stay indoors most of the time with a controlled climate. We finally estimate the reduced reproductive number and the population spared from infections due to restricting SA at 40,964, 180,336, 174,494, in China, United States, and Europe respectively. From late January to mid-April, all regions, except for China, Australia, and south Korea show a steep upward trend of spared infections due to restricting SA. US and Europe, in particular, show far steeper upward trends of spared infections in the analyzed timeframe, signaling a greater risk of reopening the economy too soon.The COVID-19, declared global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), is reporeted to have infected more than three million population in 213 countries and territories by April 2020 1 . Up-todate, it has a 30-40 times death rate of seasonal influenza (3-4% vs. 0.1%) and infects all ages 2 . Managing a controlled transition from community transmission to a low-level or no transmission is, at present, the best-case outcome in the short and medium term in the absence of an effective treatment and vaccine 6 . The restriction of socioeconomic activity (SA) is a widely adopted mitigation management by national and subnational authorities for combating the virus. Strong form of restrictions involves city lock down, mandatory quarantine, and large-scale demobilization while weak form includes shelter-inplace order allowing for the openness of essential businesses and domestic travel. The degree to which SA is restricted varies dramatically with location, time, and climate regions, and is difficult to measure directly. Additional difficulty lies with civilians' compliance with governmental orders. Consequently, the impact on suppressing the COVID-19 transmissibility of limiting SA in various weather conditions remains unknown 7 .Previous studies on restriction effects rely on news of governmental announcements controls [8][9][10][11] or human travel records 12 to predict the number of infectees in a single city, country, or regime [12][13][14][15] based on the stochastic susceptible-exposed-infectious removed (SEIR) modeling framework or its variance.","entities":[],"relations":[]}

The results suggest that mosquito pools and home foreclosures are significant in explaining the prevalence of human WNV. An innovative aspect of this research is that it emphasizes the role of home foreclosures in WNV transmission and in the allocation of resources. Knowledge of the factors associated with WNV prevalence is crucial for abatement of future outbreaks.

The mechanism is unknown, but could run through income shocks, disease exposure, or increasing opportunity cost of parental time which influences parenting behavior. We use the Vietnam Demographic Health Surveys to study how rainfall shocks around the birth year influence a key dimension of parental behavior, breastfeeding. Consistent with the opportunity cost of time theory, rainfall reduces breastfeeding: 25% excess rainfall in the birth year decreases the proportion that is breastfed more than a year by 11 percentage points. The effect is particularly strong among farming families, for whom rainfall increases the opportunity cost of time through labor demand. These results are the first to shed light on the mechanism linking rainfall shocks and child health.

Results are combined for the 5 months for northern winter (November to March) and summer (May to September). Over land, negative correlations dominate, as dry conditions favor more sunshine and less evaporative cooling, while wet summers are cool. At high latitudes in winter, positive correlations dominate as warm moist advection in extratropical cyclones favors precipitation and the water holding capacity of the atmosphere limits precipitation amounts in cold conditions. Where ocean conditions drive the atmosphere, higher surface air temperatures are associated with precipitation, as in El Nin ˜o, but some areas, such as the western Pacific in northern summer, feature negative correlations indicating that the atmosphere determines the surface temperatures. In the CAM driven with observed sea surface temperatures and the CCSM in fully coupled mode the latter mechanism is largely absent, and correlations are generally much stronger than observed, indicating more local control. Neither temperature nor precipitation records should be interpreted without considering the strong covariability that exists.","entities":[],"relations":[]}

The estimations are based on a two-stage least squares model using panel data. The elasticity of the inter-state out-migration rate with respect to per capita net state domestic agricultural product is −0.775, indicating that a decline in the value of agricultural output related to weather variations results in an increase in out-migration rate. The crop-wise analysis shows that a 1 per cent decline in rice (wheat) yield leads to a nearly 2 per cent (1 per cent) increase in the rate of out-migration from a state. The district-level analysis shows larger magnitudes of estimated change in in-migration rates to relative changes in crop yields. However, the district-level analysis using two-period panel data constructed from a single census provides relatively less robust results compared to the state-level analysis owing to the associated data limitations.The study was made possible through a financial grant by SANDEE.

{"id":"Waldman.json","text":"Autism is currently estimated to affect approximately one in every 166 children, yet the cause or causes of the condition are not well understood. One of the current theories concerning the condition is that among a set of children vulnerable to developing the condition because of their underlying genetics, the condition manifests itself when such a child is exposed to a (currently unknown) environmental trigger. In this paper we empirically investigate the hypothesis that early childhood television viewing serves as such a trigger. Using the Bureau of Labor Statistics' American Time Use Survey, we first establish that the amount of television a young child watches is positively related to the amount of precipitation in the child's community. This suggests that, if television is a trigger for autism, then autism should be more prevalent in communities that receive substantial precipitation. We then look at county-level autism data for three states --California, Oregon, and Washington --characterized by high precipitation variability. Employing a variety of tests, we show that in each of the three states (and across all three states when pooled) there is substantial evidence that county autism rates are indeed positively related to county-wide levels of precipitation. In our final set of tests we use California and Pennsylvania data on children born between 1972 and 1989 to show, again consistent with the television as trigger hypothesis, that county autism rates are also positively related to the percentage of households that subscribe to cable television. Our precipitation tests indicate that just under forty percent of autism diagnoses in the three states studied is the result of television watching due to precipitation, while our cable tests indicate that approximately seventeen percent of the growth in autism in California and Pennsylvania during the 1970s and 1980s is due to the growth of cable television. These findings are consistent with early childhood television viewing being an important trigger for autism. We also discuss further tests that can be conducted to explore the hypothesis more directly.","entities":[],"relations":[]}

Tourists carefully consider haze weather and shortlist their destinations based on these considerations. It is thus important to analyze the impact of haze weather on tourist arrivals and examine whether haze weather affects tourists' destination preference for scenic spots. This study incorporates the tourism resource heterogeneity into the push-pull theory to construct a new theoretical framework of haze weather affecting tourism. Using the Baidu Index, we obtain the daily tourist arrivals data for 73 scenic spots (4A and 5A) in Beijing and construct the FE-OLS, IV-2SLS, and air-bin models to evaluate and analyze the effects of haze weather on tourist arrivals, preferences of scenic spots, and tourism economic losses. The following conclusions are drawn. First, from a regional perspective, haze weather has a significant and negative impact on tourist arrivals. Second, the degree of the effect on tourism is related to the severity of the haze. Moderate, heavy, and severe haze led to a reduction in tourist arrivals by 2.29%, 6.0%, and 14.77%, respectively. Third, haze weather changes the choice of tourist destination from preferred cultural and natural attractions to recreational attractions. Lastly, it is estimated that Beijing lost 5.22 million tourists and 8.95 billion yuan in tourism revenue due to haze from 2016 to 2018. This study also provides policy recommendations to help the tourism industry cope with haze weather and suggestions to expand and enrich the theoretical perspective of climate change and tourism industry research.","entities":[],"relations":[]}

{"id":"Xu 2006.json","text":"It is commonly believed that greenhouse-gas-induced global warming can weaken the east Asian winter monsoon but strengthen the summer monsoon, because of stronger warming over high-latitude land as compared to low-latitude oceans. In this study, we show that the surface wind speed associated with the east Asian monsoon has significantly weakened in both winter and summer in the recent three decades. From 1969 to 2000, the annual mean wind speed over China has decreased steadily by 28%, and the prevalence of windy days (daily mean wind speed > 5 m\/s) has decreased by 58%. The temperature trends during this period have not been uniform. Significant winter warming in northern China may explain the decline of the winter monsoon, while the summer cooling in central south China and warming over the South China Sea and the western North Pacific Ocean may be responsible for weakening the summer monsoon. In addition, we found that the monsoon wind speed is also highly correlated with incoming solar radiation at the surface. The present results, when interpreted together with those of recent climate model simulations, suggest two mechanisms that govern the decline of the east Asian winter and summer monsoons, both of which may be related to human activity. The winter decline is associated with global-scale warming that may be attributed to increased greenhouse gas emission, while the summer decline is associated with local cooling over south-central China that may result from air pollution.","entities":[],"relations":[]}

Because household income and remittances are jointly determined, rainfall shocks are used as instrumental variables for income changes.
