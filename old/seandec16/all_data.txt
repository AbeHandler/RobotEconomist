"It is presumed that a paired-comparison measurement procedure which attempts to detect as many ordered pairs as possible in a set which is linearly ordered by some unidimensional attribute can identify only part of the underlying linear order L. This part is in the form of a partial order P which is a subset of L. An algorithm can then be applied to P in an attempt to identify ordered pairs in L which are not in P. Simulation experiments have shown that significantly more than 50 percent of the ordered pairs added to P by the construction process of the algorithm agree with their orders in L. However, it has also been discovered that the construction process is expected to yield better results (in a sense specified precisely in the paper) when its input is taken to be a subset of P which is obtained by removing selected ordered pairs from P. Thus, by withholding certain known and correct information from the input to the construction process, a better output is expected."

"Consistent with the reciprocal pressure hypothesis, we find that reciprocity-pressured analysts delay releasing negative information on other major underwriters’ clients despite the fact that these analysts’ affiliated underwriters do not receive fees from those clients."
"We finally derive optimal solutions explicitly for the cases in which the reference point is the risk-free return and those in which it is not (while the utility function is piecewise linear), and we employ these results to investigate comparative statics of optimal risky exposures with respect to the reference point, the LLAD, and the curvature of the probability weighting."
"We find that public research is critical to industrial R&D in a small number of industries and importantly affects industrial R&D across much of the manufacturing sector."
"A mathematical model is presented, both in a general form and in an exponential form, which relates an individual's risk attitude in health to three effects—a quantity effect, a gambling effect and a time preference effect."
"To understand the costs and benefits of marketing research, we account for the lost opportunities to produce these goods."
"Our approach determines quickly whether the workcell can meet a required demand under its current configuration and operating parameters."
"The National Science Foundation established the Decision and Management Sciences Program (DMS) in 1982."
"Princeton, New Jersey: D. Van Nostrand and Company, January 1962, 478 pp.,"
"This paper was accepted by Gustavo Manso, finance."
"E. S. Phelps et al.,"
"Understanding user behavior is necessary for better assessment of these sites' survival."
"Our approach to modeling the productivity of computer systems is based on conventional economic theory and empirical analysis."
"The estimators are based on Lp norms of standardized time series, and they generalize previously studied estimators due to Schruben."
"Closed form, easy to use, lot-size type formulae are derived which calculate the required frequency (or upper bounds) between audits."
"The results indicate that the structure of model uncertainty, and specifically how model disagreement varies in abatement, is the key driver of optimal abatement and that model uncertainty warrants a higher level of climate change mitigation."
"Are the costs of time and effort spent on analyzing decisions outweighed by benefits?"
"These insights are verified through a simulation comparison of five cellular manufacturing systems with a functional layout system in which optimal lot sizes, low move times and a part family-oriented scheduling rule are used."
"The efficacy of conditional Monte Carlo and its use in conjunction with other Monte Carlo methods is illustrated for the Wheatstone bridge network."
"To assist suppliers, we also develop a bidding-suggestion device based on a myopic best-response (MBR) calculation that solves an associated optimization problem."
"Using a think-aloud process-tracing methodology, we examine the data modeling behavior as a set of activities that are managed by several heuristics."
"The value of this breadth is in conveying the shape of the entire research landscape."
"The experiment involved playing a series of games under the twin conditions of (1) uncertainty and (2) dialectical advice."
"We also show that … Implicit understandings result in greater channel profits than in their absence."
"The proposed strategy uses predictable returns to reduce this cost."
"In particular, attention was given to stabilizing procedures, to making decisions in the face of uncertainty and to improving communication."
"Using the data on time-to-recovery for individual drug-shortage incident and annual-days-of-shortage for each drug, we find that the new policy alleviates drug shortages, but its effectiveness is contingent upon the prevailing level of competition in the product category."
"The emphasis is added because in some cases common random numbers can be counterproductive when performing comparisons with a standard."
"For comparison purposes, a noncyclical heuristic and problem sets from the literature are used."
"An ordinary linear programming problem is formulated as  under the constraints  where A is a matrix with m rows and n columns, x and c are column vectors with n elements, and b is a column vector with n elements."
"Interestingly, a higher probability of implementation failure can lead to lower investment risks and higher expected profits."
"Walk/ride and pick systems are a popular method for performing this chore in many applications."
"Previous research has shown that the increasingly common practice of outsourcing back-office IS generally has a positive effect on shareholder value of the outsourcing firm."
"We find that the lift on product views is greater for utilitarian products compared with hedonic products as well as for experience products compared with search products."
"The system is controlled by a repair policy of control limit type: a preventive repair on the working unit is carried out as soon as the state of this unit exceeds a certain threshold unless the repair facility is occupied by the other unit."
