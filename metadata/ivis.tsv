"Structural and parametric identification of nonlinear continuous dynamic systems with a closed cycle on a set of continuous block-oriented models with feedback is considered. The method of structural identification in the steady state based on the observation of the system's input and output variables at the input periodic influences is proposed. The solution of the parameter identification problems, which can be immediately connected with the structural identification problem, is carried out in the steady and transient states by the method of least squares. The structural and parametric identification algorithms are investigated by means of both theoretical analysis and computer modeling."	5eqvzuf26n	"IDENTIFICATION OF NONLINEAR CONTINUOUS DYNAMIC SYSTEMS WITH CLOSED CYCLE."

"This paper presents an empirical study of changes that firms implement in their board-level IT governance (ITG) upon experiencing operational IT failures. Consistent with the separation of oversight from management decisions, board-level ITG is responsible for monitoring managerial IT decisions and policies for controlling IT resources. We expect that operational IT failures indicating inadequacies in board monitoring of controls over IT resources would result in a negative stock market reaction and, in turn, induce firms to improve their board-level ITG. Our expectation is confirmed based on a sample of 110 operational IT failures from U.S. public financial firms. Specifically, our results demonstrate that subsequent to experiencing operational IT failures, firms make improvements to the IT competency level of their boards, and the improvements are proportional to the degree of negative market reaction. However, those improvements are only on the executive side of the board, namely: an increase in the IT experience of internal (executive) directors and an increased turnover rate of CIOs serving on the board. Furthermore, the likelihood of CIO turnover is lower in ITintensive firms where such turnover could be more disruptive. Our results contribute to understanding the critical connection between operational IT failures and board-level ITG."	sszbdipxyb	"OPERATIONAL IT FAILURES, IT VALUE DESTRUCTION, AND BOARD-LEVEL IT GOVERNANCE CHANGES."
"In this paper, we estimate the impact of enforcing the Convention on Cybercrime (COC) on deterring distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks. Our data set comprises a sample of real, random spoof-source DDOS attacks recorded in 106 countries in 177 days in the period 2004–2008. We find that enforcing the COC decreases DDOS attacks by at least 11.8 percent, but a similar deterrence effect does not exist if the enforcing countries make a reservation on international cooperation. We also find evidence of network and displacement effects in COC enforcement. Our findings imply attackers in cyberspace are rational, motivated by economic incentives, and strategic in choosing attack targets. We draw related implications."	gxhlxgdcdf	"CYBERCRIME DETERRENCE AND INTERNATIONAL LEGISLATION: EVIDENCE FROM DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACKS."
"Based on the “wisdom of the crowd” effect, consumer-generated online reviews are supposed to help consumers make more accurate product evaluations. However, the large amount of information in the reviews, coupled with conflicting opinions, can make it difficult for consumers to identify and consider those attributes relevant to their decision. Thus, while online product reviews are generally believed to empower consumers, we suggest that they may have “swaying” effects in that attribute preferences (i.e., the relative importance consumers place on various product attributes in product evaluation) are more heavily influenced by characteristics of the online reviews rather than by the relevance of the attributes to the consumers’ decision context. We propose that three characteristics of online reviews affect the assessment of attribute preferences: (1) the amount of information about attribute-level performance, which is often unevenly distributed across attributes, (2) the degree of information conflict about attribute-level performance, and (3) the relationship between the overall numeric rating and the attribute-level performance information in the reviews. We test our hypotheses in two randomized experiments and a free simulation study. Results from the three studies show that the three review characteristics influence attribute preferences and that their effects are strong enough such that attribute preferences are influenced more by these online review characteristics than by the relevance of the attributes to the consumers’ decision context. Our work, which illustrates a dark side to online reviews, has implications for both online word-of-mouth and preference construction research."	ww6rgfhyyf	"THE DARK SIDE OF REVIEWS: THE SWAYING EFFECTS OF ONLINE PRODUCT REVIEWS ON ATTRIBUTE PREFERENCE CONSTRUCTION."
"With the increasing popularity of product recommendation networks in e-commerce, researchers and practitioners are eager to understand how they can strategically manage product assortments through the manipulation of such networks to drive demand. We examine product recommendation networks in e-commerce to investigate how the demand of a product is influenced by product network attributes in terms of network diversity and network stability. We also examine whether the demand of a product is influenced by both the incoming network and the outgoing network, and if the effects differ between co-view and co-purchase recommendation networks. Using data from Tmall.com for four product categories, we apply linear panel data models to examine the impact of network diversity and network stability on product demand, controlling for relevant factors at the individual product, pricing, product network, product category, and time unit levels. Importantly, we account for implicit demand correlation (i.e., substitution and complementarity) and potential simultaneity of demand and network structures. We unravel several important findings. First, a 1% increase in the category diversity of the incoming (outgoing) co-purchase network of a product is associated with a 0.011% (0.012%) increase (decrease) in the product’s demand. Second, a 1% increase in the stability of the outgoing co-purchase network is associated with a 0.012% decrease in demand. Third, the demand effects of network diversity and stability are both stronger in the co-purchase network, compared to their insignificant effects in the co-view network. Thus, this research provides theoretical contributions in terms of the economic effects of product recommendation networks through its focus on network diversity and stability in incoming/ outgoing and co-view/co-purchase networks. We also provide notable implications for recommendation-based product marketing and recommendation systems design."	itjxymmibf	"THE DEMAND EFFECTS OF PRODUCT RECOMMENDATION NETWORKS: AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF NETWORK DIVERSITY AND STABILITY."

"One fundamental economic challenge in social gaming is how to monetize players. We address this problem from the lens of social influence. Specifically, we examine how players' paying behaviors in a social game are associated with their pure friends and Simmelian-tie friends. Analyzing a comprehensive social game dataset provided by Tencent.com, we find that the cohesion effect emanating from players' direct connections in the social gaming network exhibits positive impacts on players' willingness to pay. Surprisingly, the cohesion effect of pure friends is found to be significantly stronger than that of Simmelian-tie friends, contrary to the common findings in the literature. These new findings have direct implications for companies tasked with designing social games or gamification <mark>systems</mark> and, more broadly, to help better understand the mechanism behind the microscopic economic behavior of individuals in a virtual economy."	ja3e56mykf	"Social Influence and Monetization of Freemium Social Games."
"We study how consumers decide which tariff plan to choose and whether to churn when their friends churn in the mobile industry. We develop a theoretical model showing conditions under which users remain with their carrier and conditions under which they churn when their friends do. We then use a large and rich anonymized longitudinal panel of call detailed records to characterize the consumers' path to death with unprecedented level of detail. We explore the structure of the network inferred from these data to derive instruments for friends' churn, which is typically endogenous in network settings. This allows us to econometrically identify the effect of peer influence in our setting. On average, we find that each additional friend that churns increases the monthly churn rate by 0.06 percent. The observed monthly churn rate across our dataset is 2.15 percent. We also find that firms introducing the pre-paid tariff plans that charge the same price to call users inside and outside the carrier help retain consumers that would otherwise churn. In our setting, without this tariff plan the monthly churn rate could have been as high as 8.09 percent. We perform a number of robustness checks, in particular to how we define friends in the social graph, and show that our results remain unchanged. Our paper shows that the traditional definition of customer lifetime value underestimates the value of consumers and, in particular, that of consumers with more friends due to the effect of contagious churn and, therefore, managers should actively take into account the structure of the social network when prioritizing whom to target during retention campaigns."	7p4pa3oqhv	"Effect of Friends' Churn on Consumer Behavior in Mobile Networks."
"Health consumers are increasingly participating in consumer-to-consumer (C2C) online health communities (OHCs) to receive health-related support and to provide assistance and support to others. However, questions remain as to how individual OHC participants are affected by the relationships they have established within an OHC and how the content exchanged between OHC participants impacts individual-level health knowledge and attitudes. To address these open questions, we develop a model that integrates participant network position (i.e., structural social capital) in an OHC, informational and emotional support exchange, and downstream individual-level health knowledge and attitudes. Based on a panel dataset collected from nine chronic disease-focused discussion boards within an OHC platform, we find that structural social capital is indeed a significant antecedent to social support exchange within an OHC and, interestingly, that social support provisioning (i.e., proactively aiding others) has a stronger effect than social support receipt on health literacy and health attitude improvement."	5vjv75s7pv	"Fostering Participant Health Knowledge and Attitudes: An Econometric Study of a Chronic Disease-Focused Online Health Community."
"Open source software (OSS) communities are dependent on the code contributions of developers who, in many cases, never meet face-to-face and collaborate primarily through technology-enabled means. With their fluid membership, such communities often rely on engaging the commitment of developers to their cause. Given the changing nature of OSS communities, developers face barriers in appreciating appropriate ways of contributing to the collaborative effort. Such uncertainty about how to contribute results in OSS communities losing developers as they devote their attention to other, more welcoming, communities. In this research, we draw upon uncertainty reduction theory to argue that developers have two alternative avenues at their disposal to gain certainty about how to contribute: passive and interactive. Leveraging the person-environment fit perspective, we argue that congruence and incongruence in the OSS values of a developer and an OSS community serve as an avenue for passive approaches to gaining certainty, to the degree that appropriate ways of contributing are encoded in these values. Further, leveraging social network theory, we argue that centrality within a community's communication network constitutes an avenue for interactive approaches for gaining certainty about how to contribute. Using polynomial regression analysis, we analyze survey and archival data from 410 developers in an OSS community. Results suggest that developer centrality moderates the impact of congruence and incongruence in OSS values on commitment. Moreover, commitment fully mediates the impact of OSS value congruence and incongruence on developer contribution activity. We discuss the implications of our findings for research and practice."	zzvovshqj5	"DEVELOPER CENTRALITY AND THE IMPACT OF VALUE CONGRUENCE AND INCONGRUENCE ON COMMITMENT AND CODE CONTRIBUTION ACTIVITY IN OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE COMMUNITIES."
"This paper examines the role of parenting behaviors in influencing children's Internet addiction and the consequences of children's Internet addiction on parents' job outcomes. First, we draw on attachment theory to theorize that five parenting behaviors (i.e., parental control, monitoring, unstructured time, dissuasion, and rationalization) affect children's Internet addiction and their effects are moderated by the children's views of parent-child attachment. Second, we draw on research on the work-family interface to theorize that children's Internet addiction affects parents' job outcomes (i.e., job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and work exhaustion) and the effects are mediated by family-to-work conflict. We tested our hypotheses using an integrated research approach that includes quantitative and qualitative data. We conducted an online survey to collect quantitative responses from 776 parent-child dyads. The results of our model showed that the effects of parenting behaviors on children's Internet addiction, except for dissuasion, were moderated by the children's views of parent-child attachment. Also, family-to-work conflict mediated the effects of children's Internet addiction on parents' job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and work exhaustion.

"Regulatory focus theory (RFT) has been regarded as an important theory for understanding customer behavior in e-commerce; however, there is a significant gap between theoretical analysis with RFT and its practical applications. In particular, there is little research on how to identify the chronic regulatory focus of customers; as such, it is difficult to apply RFT in e-commerce operations. To fill this research gap, we propose an innovative method to operationalize customer regulatory focus from the affective dimension, leading to operationalized regulatory focus (ORF). In this regard, our study spearheads a new avenue of research on how social theories can be operationalized and applied in e-commerce operations. We first identify customers' chronic regulatory focus (i.e., promotion focus or prevention focus) based on online review data using text mining, leading to an innovative method we refer to as \"regulatory focus discovery.\" Then, we validate the computed results on regulatory focus by surveying corresponding customers included in the same dataset. Finally, we evaluate the applicability of ORF via an econometric analysis. In this article, we demonstrate that it is possible to compute regulatory focus of specific customers for the purpose of assessing their purchasing tendency. The theoretical and practical implications of ORF are discussed."	h7keggdy4v	"OPERATIONALIZING REGULATORY FOCUS IN THE DIGITAL AGE: EVIDENCE FROM AN E-COMMERCE CONTEXT."
"This study investigates employee behavior of unauthorized access attempts on information systems (IS) applications in a financial institution and examines how opportunity contexts facilitate such behavior. By contextualizing multilevel criminal opportunity theory, we develop a model that considers both employee- and department-level opportunity contexts. At the employee level, we hypothesize that the scope and data value of the applications that an employee has legitimately accessed, together with the time when and location where the employee initiates access, affect the likelihood of the employee making unauthorized access attempts. At the department level, we hypothesize that department size moderates the impact of employee-level contextual variables on the likelihood of an employee making unauthorized attempts. To test these hypotheses, we collected six months of access log data from an enterprise single sign-on system of a financial institution. We find the hypothesized main effects of all employee-level contextual variables and department size are supported. In addition, department size reinforces the effects of data value, off-hour access, off-site access, and their interaction term, except for that of scope, on the outcome <mark>variable</mark>. Robustness analyses indicate that the proposed model does not align with those employees who might not know the systems well enough or who might make honest mistakes.

"The alignment between a firm’s business and information technology (IT) strategies continues to be important for research and practice. Prior research investigating the performance consequences of strategic IT alignment (SITA) has produced inconsistent results. This paper distinguishes between two roles of SITA: (1) as a state of congruence between business and IT, which is the primary focus of empirical studies, and (2) as reflecting a capability that may enable or inhibit the leveraging of IT investments, as has been discussed theoretically but not examined empirically. Based on the resource-based view (RBV), IT investment (ITI) is explicitly included as the resource that SITA as a capability can inherently help leverage. Also based on RBV, we argue that environmental uncertainty, which is examined in terms of dynamism, complexity, and munificence, moderates the effect of SITA on the relationship between ITI and firm performance. The research model is tested through panel-data analyses of data from 1999–2008, including 758 firm-year observations from 242 firms. This study is the first to find that SITA as a state directly improves firm performance even when considering ITI and its interaction with SITA. Moreover, the effect of the interaction between SITA and ITI on firm performance increases with an increase in environmental dynamism or complexity and with a decrease in environmental munificence. We also find that the effect of the interaction between SITA and ITI can be negative under some environments. Specifically, the results suggest that (1) in dynamic, complex, and hostile environments, SITA does reflect a capability that enhances the positive effect of ITI on firm performance, but (2) in stable, simple, and munificent environments, SITA reflects a rigidity that reduces the positive effect of ITI on firm performance. The results are robust under a variety of statistical specifications and estimations."	ng7qiyzysj	"HOW DOES STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT AFFECT FIRM PERFORMANCE?

"The bursts and multiplicity of Internet advertising have made multichannel attribution an immediate challenge for marketing practitioners. Existing attribution models predominantly focus on analyzing consumers’ conversion paths with respect to one focal firm while largely overlooking the impact of their interactions with competing firms, leading to biased estimates of advertising effectiveness. We address this problem by developing an integrated individual-level choice model that considers consumers’ online visit and purchase decisions across all competitors within one industry. We specifically analyze the effects of multichannel advertising on (1) consumer choice of entry site, (2) consumer search decisions concerning the remaining competing websites, and (3) subsequent purchase at one of the searched websites. We quantify the impact of different digital advertising channels on consumers’ decisions at different purchase funnel stages based on individual-level click stream data from the online air ticket booking industry. We find that information stock of all online channels considered—search, display/referral, email, direct—contributes significantly to consumers’ visit and purchase decisions, among which search is the most effective advertising channel in driving all three decisions. We map the estimates to the conversion attribution of different channels. The result reveals that the relative contribution of the display/referral channel was underestimated under the popular single-firm attribution models by a factor of two on average. In terms of predictive performance, our model consistently outperforms the single-firm model in predicting the occurrences of future purchases."	2jvfflntlv	"MODELING MULTICHANNEL ADVERTISING ATTRIBUTION ACROSS COMPETITORS."
"As of 2007, an estimated 62% of individual bankruptcy filings in the United States were a direct result of costs borne from medical treatment following illness or injury, up from 46% in 2001. This pressing issue is only getting worse and is in need of relief. In this work, we consider the potential of a relatively recent, and rapidly growing, phenomenon to mitigate the problem: online crowdfunding for medical expenses, wherein patients reach out to their social network for monetary support via online platforms that facilitate the process. On the surface, medical crowdfunding holds the potential to address insurance gaps and to help those burdened by medical debt. However, recent questions have arisen in the healthcare literature around fairness and equity in the distribution of funds. Consistent with the notion of digital divide, many have raised concerns that the individuals most likely to benefit from these services are not the individuals who are most in need. Accordingly, we first seek to establish the effect of this novel phenomenon on a key indicator of financial distress: rates of personal bankruptcy. We then explore heterogeneity in patterns of funding solicitation and acquisition, to assess the presence inequalities across patient populations. We leverage proprietary data from a large medical crowdfunding platform based in the United States, which we combine with county records of personal bankruptcy filings. We report evidence that greater success amongst medical crowdfunding campaigns does translate into a reduction in personal bankruptcy filings. Subsequently, we report analyses which revealed evidence consistent with the presence of a digital divide. Specifically, we report evidence that disadvantaged groups are systematically more likely to launch medical crowdfunding campaigns, yet conditional on campaign launch, garner systematically less in funding. We discuss the implications for the literature on the digital divide, as well as implications for practice and policy."	bcasdj4bdz	"INVESTIGATING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MEDICAL CROWDFUNDING AND PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY IN THE UNITED STATES: EVIDENCE OF A DIGITAL DIVIDE."
"Crowdsourcing contests are contests by which organizations tap into the wisdom of crowds by outsourcing tasks to large groups of people on the Internet. In an online environment often characterized by anonymity and lack of trust, there are inherent uncertainties for participants of such contests. This study focuses on crowdsourcing contests with winner-take-all prizes. During these contests, submissions are made sequentially and contest hosts can provide public in-process feedback to the submissions as soon as they are received. Drawing on the uncertainty literature, we examine how the use of prize guarantees (guaranteeing that a winner will be picked and paid) and in-process feedback (numeric ratings to individual designs and public textual comments during the contest) can help attract more submissions by influencing the various uncertainties faced by the contestants. We find that guaranteeing the prize increases submissions. The volume of in-process feedback (both numeric reviews and textual comments) has a positive effect on the number of submissions, and such an effect is bigger in contests without prize guarantees. In addition, providing highly positive or extremely negative feedback discourages overall future submissions, and the negative effect of highly positive feedback is mitigated in guaranteed contests."	ubozohyp2b	"MANAGING THE CROWDS: THE EFFECT OF PRIZE GUARANTEES AND IN-PROCESS FEEDBACK ON PARTICIPATION IN CROWDSOURCING CONTESTS."
"Online hacker forums offer a prominent avenue for sharing hacking knowledge. Using a field dataset culled from multiple sources, we find that online discussion of distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks in hackforums.net decreases the number of DDOS-attack victims. A 1% increase in discussion decreases DDOS attacks by 0.032% to 0.122%. This means that two DDOS-attack posts per day could reduce the number of victims by 700 to 2,600 per day. We find that discussion topics with similar keywords can variously increase or decrease DDOS attacks, meaning we cannot ascertain the impact of the discussion just by the post nature. Mentioning botnets, especially new botnets, increases the attacks, but the follow-up discussion decreases the attacks. Our results suggest that online-hacker-forum discussion may exhibit the dual-use characteristic. That is, it can be used for both good and bad purposes.

"The proliferation of smartphones and other mobile devices has led to numerous companies investing significant resources in developing mobile applications, in every imaginable domain. As apps proliferate, understanding the impact of app adoption on key outcomes of interest and linking this understanding to the underlying mechanisms that drive these results is imperative. In this paper, we explore the changes in user behavior induced by adoption of a mobile application, in terms of engagement and matching outcomes in the online dating context. We also identify three mechanisms that are somewhat unique to the mobile environment, but are hitherto unestablished in the literature, that drive this shift in behavior: ubiquity, impulsivity, and disinhibition. Our main identification strategy uses propensity score matching combined with difference-in-differences, coupled with a rigorous falsification test to confirm the validity of our identification strategy. Our results demonstrate that mobile app adoption induces users to become more socially engaged as measured by key engagement metrics such as visiting significantly more profiles, sending significantly more messages, and importantly, achieving more matches. We also discover various mechanisms facilitating this increased engagement: ubiquity of mobile use—users log in more, and login across a wider range of hours in the day. We find that men act more impulsively, in that they are less likely to check the profile of a user who messaged them before replying to them. This effect is not visible for women who continue to be deliberate in their checking before replying even after adoption of the mobile app. Finally, we find that both men and women exhibit disinhibition, in that users initiate actions to a more diverse set of potential partners than they did before on dimensions of race, education, and height."	dgrwgocd4n	"LOVE UNSHACKLED: IDENTIFYING THE EFFECT OF MOBILE APP ADOPTION IN ONLINE DATING."

"Motivated by the rise of social media platforms that achieve a fusion of content and community, we consider the role of word-of-mouth communications (WOM) structured through a network. Using a data set from YouTube, we examine how cascades of WOM interactions enhance the popularity of videos. We first estimate the impact of channel influence and other network parameters in initiating WOM communications. The probit estimation considers the selection effect in videos that are likely to be associated with a greater propensity to trigger WOM. We find that factors related to a channel’s ability to be a connector and a translator is most likely to result in the incidence of WOM. We then examine how cascades of WOM conversations have persistent impacts on subsequent video popularity. Empirically, the main issue here is heterogeneity in the epidemic potential of a video.

"It is by now almost accepted as a stylized fact that offering deal promotion (such as via Groupon or LivingSocial) deteriorates local merchants’ online reputations (e.g., the average of Yelp review ratings). However, in this paper we show that the stylized fact is not true in certain circumstances. We theorize that the valence and volume of prior reviews can play an important moderating role in the effect of deal promotion. Empirically, we show that restaurants with a relatively low prior average rating and a relatively small review volume have improved their online reputations by offering Groupon promotion. The proportion of such restaurants is substantial. The findings are robust to multiple identification strategies and econometric specifications. The results underscore the substantial heterogeneity in the effect of deal promotion on local merchants’ online reputations.

"We explore the issue of seller differentiation in competitive auction environments, where most sellers have a high percentage of positive feedback. Analyzing a set of eBay auction listings for identical products, we find evidence that the use of visibility-enhancing and quality-signaling discretionary auction attributes affects auction outcomes throughout the auction process (i.e., listing views, bids, and price premiums). We also find strong evidence that the number of reputable sellers in an auction marketplace moderates the effects of these discretionary attributes on auction outcomes. Specifically, as auction environments become more competitive, these attributes become more effective tools for differentiation, whereas seller feedback scores become less effective. Furthermore, sellers appear to select their strategies for employing these discretionary attributes based on both their prior experience and the number of experienced reputable sellers in the market. These findings suggest that in addition to relying on feedback scores, online sellers must take a more strategic approach in the selection of discretionary attributes in their auction listings."	c7d4eq572n	"Seller Strategies for Differentiation in Highly Competitive Online Auction Markets."
"Modern online retailing practices provide consumers with new types of real-time information that can potentially increase demand. In particular, showing sales information to a customer can increase certainty about product quality, inducing consumers to herd. This effect can be particularly salient for experience goods due to their quality being inherently highly uncertain. Social media word-of-mouth (WOM) can increase product awareness as product information spreads via social media, increasing demand directly while amplifying existing quality signals such as past sales. This study examines the mechanisms behind the strategy of facilitating herding and the strategy of integrating social media platforms to understand the potential complementarities between the two strategies. We conduct empirical analysis using data from Groupon.com, which sells goods in a fast cycle format of \"daily deals.\" We find that facilitating herding and integrating social media platforms are complements that generate sales, supporting the idea that it is beneficial to combine the two strategies on social media platforms. Furthermore, we find that herding is more salient for experience goods, consistent with our hypothesized mechanisms, while the effect of social media WOM is similar for experience goods and search goods."	lf4ava7pfj	"HERDING AND SOCIAL MEDIA WORD-OF-MOUTH: EVIDENCE FROM GROUPON."
"This paper examines how (1) a crowdfunding campaign's prosociality (the production of a public versus private good), (2) the social network structure (embeddedness) among individuals advocating for the campaign on social media, and (3) the volume of social media activity around a campaign jointly determine fundraising from the crowd. Integrating the emerging literature on social media and crowdfunding with the literature on social networks and public goods, we theorize that prosocially, public-oriented crowdfunding campaigns will benefit disproportionately from social media activity when advocates' social media networks exhibit greater levels of embeddedness. Drawing on a panel dataset that combines campaign fundraising activity associated with more than 1,000 campaigns on Kickstarter with campaign-related social media activity on Twitter, we construct network-level measures of embeddedness between and amongst individuals initiating the latter, in terms of transitivity and topological overlap. We demonstrate that Twitter activity drives a disproportionate increase in fundraising for prosocially oriented crowdfunding campaigns when posting users' networks exhibit greater embeddedness. We discuss the theoretical implications of our findings, highlighting how our work extends prior research on the role of embeddedness in peer influence by demonstrating the joint roles of message features and network structure in the peer influence process. Our work suggests that when a transmitter's message is prosocial or cause-oriented, embeddedness will play a stronger role in determining influence. We also discuss the broader theoretical implications for the literatures on social media, crowdfunding, crowdsourcing, and private contributions to public goods. Finally, we highlight the practical implications for marketers, campaign organizers, and crowdfunding platform operators."	dyp2r44tcf	"EMBEDDEDNESS, PROSOCIALITY, AND SOCIAL INFLUENCE: EVIDENCE FROM ONLINE CROWDFUNDING."
"The diffusion of new information technology (IT) requires the development of an ecosystem of hardware and software producers, users, and other firms. It is widely believed that venture capitalists (VCs) can play a role in the development of such ecosystems. However, empirical research to elaborate on these points is lacking. Focusing on the recent rapid rise of one platform, cloud computing, we assemble a unique dataset to look at the period just before wide acceptance of the cloud. We find evidence of complementarity between VC financing and the introduction of new products offered over the cloud. Moreover, the complementarity effects are significantly stronger for firms backed by VCs that had rich experience in the IT industry and are significantly weaker for firms that had prior experience developing traditional client/server products. These results provide evidence that supports a role for VC financing in the creation of new technological ecosystems."	f5pkjnxipj	"THE ROLE OF VENTURE CAPITAL IN THE FORMATION OF A NEW TECHNOLOGICAL ECOSYSTEM: EVIDENCE FROM THE CLOUD."
"Certification mechanisms are often employed to assess and signal difficult-to-observe management practices and foster improvement. In the U.S. healthcare sector, a certification mechanism called meaningful-use attestation was recently adopted as part of an effort to encourage electronic health record (EHR) adoption while also focusing healthcare providers on protecting sensitive healthcare data. This new regime motivated us to examine how meaningful-use attestation influences the occurrence of data breaches. Using a propensity score matching technique combined with a difference-in-differences (DID) approach, our study shows that the impact of meaningful-use attestation is contingent on the nature of data breaches and the time frame. Hospitals that attest to having reached Stage 1 meaningful-use standards observe fewer external breaches in the short term, but do not see continued improvement in the following year. On the other hand, attesting hospitals observe short-term increases in accidental internal breaches but eventually see long-term reductions. We do not find any link between malicious internal breaches and attestation. Our findings offer theoretical and practical insights into the effective design of certification mechanisms."	i2i2fc6wc5	"MEANINGFUL HEALTHCARE SECURITY: DOES MEANINGFUL-USE ATTESTATION IMPROVE INFORMATION SECURITY PERFORMANCE?"
"Prior research on corporate governance has offered contradictory empirical evidence on the relationship between the independence of the board of directors (the degree to which the board consists of outside directors who are not affiliated with the company) and firm performance. Building on the contingency view of corporate governance, we argue that the presence of significant new entry threats (NET), a unique feature that differentiates the IT industry from many other industries, is a critical contextual <mark>variable</mark> that moderates this relationship. Leveraging a novel NET measure based on text mining, we show that facing high NET, firms with boards that have a higher proportion of independent directors, who contribute to explorative organizational learning, carry out more effective monitoring, and offer independent opinions in strategic decision making, outperform firms with fewer independent board members. To address the endogeneity of board independence, we use the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related changes to the NYSE/NASDAQ listing rules as exogenous shocks; we show that our results are robust to the correction for endogeneity issues. Further, we show that our findings are generalizable to other high tech industries that face significant threats of new entry emerging from fast-moving industry dynamics. However, these results do not extend to slow-moving industries that have a stable market structure and thereby face lower and more homogenous levels of NET. We discuss the implications for future research, and provide managerial guidelines for practice as well."	52hc3d65cv	"BOARD INDEPENDENCE AND FIRM PERFORMANCE IN THE IT INDUSTRY: THE MODERATING ROLE OF NEW ENTRY THREATS."
"Does a provider’s technology support strategy influence its buyers’ post-adoption IT service use? We study this question in the context of cloud infrastructure services. The provider offers two levels of support, basic and full. Under basic support, the provider handles simple service quality issues. Under full support, the provider also offers education, training, and personalized guidance through two-way interactions with buyers. Using unique data on public cloud infrastructure services use by 22,179 firms from March 2009 to August 2012, we find that buyers who receive full support use the service 34.85 percent more than other users. We further show that buyers who have full support deploy infrastructure services more efficiently, increasing the fraction of servers they run in parallel by 3.53 percentage points relative to those who do not. Furthermore, buyers who drop full support and switch back to basic support continue using 15.01 percent more of the service and have a proportion of servers running in parallel that is 2.82 percentage points higher compared to buyers who have never received full support. These findings provide suggestive evidence of buyer learning as a result of provider support."	ww7c6mwt3r	"TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT AND POST-ADOPTION IT SERVICE USE: EVIDENCE FROM THE CLOUD."
"In this paper, we explore how keyword ambiguity can affect search advertising performance. Consumers arrive at search engines with diverse interests, which are often unobserved and nontrivial to predict. The search interests of different consumers may vary even when they are searching using the same keyword. In our study, we propose an automatic way of examining keyword ambiguity based on probabilistic topic models from machine learning and computational linguistics. We examine the effect of keyword ambiguity on keyword performance using a hierarchical Bayesian approach that allows for topic-specific effects and nonlinear position effects, and jointly models click-through rate (CTR) and ad position (rank). We validate our study using a novel data set from a major search engine that contains information on consumer click activities for 2,625 distinct keywords across multiple product categories from 10,000 impressions. We find that consumer click behavior varies significantly across keywords, and such variation can be partially explained by keyword ambiguity. Specifically, higher keyword ambiguity is associated with higher CTR on top-positioned ads, but also a faster decay in CTR with screen position. Therefore, the overall effect of keyword ambiguity on CTR varies across positions. Our study provides implications for advertisers to improve the prediction of keyword performance by taking into account keyword ambiguity and other semantic characteristics of keywords. It can also help search engines design keyword planning tools to aid advertisers when choosing potential keywords."	k2v4ho5skv	"EXAMINING THE IMPACT OF KEYWORD AMBIGUITY ON SEARCH ADVERTISING PERFORMANCE: A TOPIC MODEL APPROACH."
"Making sustainable profits from a baseline zero price and motivating free consumers to convert to premium subscribers is a continuing challenge for all freemium communities. Prior research has causally established that social engagement (Oestreicher-Singer and Zalmanson 2013) and peer influence (Bapna and Umyarov 2015) are two important drivers of users converting to premium subscribers in such communities. In this paper, we flip the perspective of prior research and ask whether the decision to pay for a premium subscription causes users to become more socially engaged. In the context of the Last.fm music listening freemium social community, we establish, using a novel 41-month-long panel dataset, a look-ahead propensity score matching (LA-PSM) procedure coupled with a difference-in-difference estimator of the treatment effect, that payment for premium leads to more social engagement. Specifically, we find that paying for premium leads to an increase in both content-related and community-related social engagement. Free users who convert to premium listen to 287.2% more songs, create 1.92% more playlists, exhibit a 2.01% increase in the number of forum posts made, and gain 15.77% more friends. Thus, premium subscribers create value not only for themselves by consuming more content, but also for the community and site by organizing more content and adding more friends, who are subsequently engaged by the social diffusion emerging from the focal user’s activities."	momsrxidfn	"MONETIZING FREEMIUM COMMUNITIES: DOES PAYING FOR PREMIUM INCREASE SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT?"

"How should digital platforms engage with and invest in their online communities to shape innovation and knowledge contributions from members in their platform ecosystems? This is an important question because user contributions are important drivers of technological progress and business value. We examine the effect of platform sponsors’ investments in online communities on user knowledge contributions, using fine-grained longitudinal data from a leading enterprise software vendor’s community network. We focus on the sponsor practice of knowledge seeding, in which its employees provide free technical support by answering questions posted in discussion forums. We define user knowledge contribution as peer-evaluated, quality-weighted solutions that community members provide to help resolve the questions their peers raise. We show that the platform sponsor’s investments in knowledge seeding have a positive, significant association with user knowledge contribution. We also find temporal and geographical variations in returns on the sponsor’s knowledge investments. Specifically, returns (i.e., amount of user contribution that is stimulated) decrease with the age of the community, consistent with the observation that the most active contributors are lead users who tend to join the community early. In addition, returns vary across different countries, such that greater returns are realized when the investment is made in countries with higher levels of information technology (IT) infrastructure, partly because country-level IT infrastructure may be associated with greater absorptive capacity of these countries. We discuss the implications for research and practice."	em34uchtdz	"PLATFORM SPONSOR INVESTMENTS AND USER CONTRIBUTIONS IN KNOWLEDGE COMMUNITIES: THE ROLE OF KNOWLEDGE SEEDING."

We use a combination of secondary as well as matched-pair survey data from 100 mid-size firms in Spain to investigate this relationship. The empirical analysis suggests that IT infrastructure flexibility affects M&amp;A through two key pathways: (1) a flexible IT infrastructure facilitates the development of business flexibility that provides the responsiveness to seize M&amp;A opportunities and make acquisitions, and (2) a flexible IT infrastructure facilitates the development of post-M&amp;A IT integration capability that provides the control to integrate the IT and business resources of the acquired firm and realize the economic benefits from M&amp;A."	qh56mfjaoz	"IMPACT OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE FLEXIBILITY ON MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS."

"In this study, we estimate the effect of \"online following,\" a basic form of online social interaction, on members' contributions in open source software (OSS) communities, using a unique longitudinal data set containing <mark>information</mark> on over 4 million OSS developers and their social interactions over 7 years. We find that obtaining new followers in the previous month has a significant positive effect on developers' level of contribution in the current month. The effect carries over to the next month although the marginal effect decreases. We further find that the effect of new followers on their contribution level is much stronger for freelancers than those with company affiliation. In contrast to the previous literature that posited the existence of non-monetary incentives for developers who contribute to the OSS communities, our result suggests the existence of incentives that are tied to future monetary rewards for developers on these platforms. Our findings have important implications for the OSS platforms as well as the OSS community. OSS platform designers may consult our results to learn about the social features that affect members' contribution. We also encourage OSS community to use the \"following\" feature more prominently on OSS platforms to incentivize higher contribution levels to the projects."	g2hcwwhbwv	"Effect of \"Following\" on Contributions to Open Source Communities."

"The increasing availability of individual-level data has raised the standards for measurability and accountability in digital advertising. Using a massive individual-level data set, our paper captures the effectiveness of display advertising across a wide range of consumer behaviors. Two unique features of our data set that distinguish this paper from prior work are (1) the information on the actual viewability of impressions as on average 55% of the display ads are not rendered viewable and (2) the duration of exposure to the display advertisements, both at the individual-user level. Employing a quasi-experiment enabled by our setting, we use difference-in-differences and corresponding matching methods as well as <mark>instrumental</mark> <mark>variable</mark> techniques to control for unobservable and observable confounders. We empirically demonstrate that mere exposure to display advertising increases users’ propensity to search for the brand and the corresponding product; consumers engage both in active search exerting effort to gather information, and in passive search using information sources that arrive exogenously. We also find statistically and economically significant effects of display advertising on increasing consumers’ propensity to make a purchase. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the longer the duration of exposure to display advertising, the more likely the consumers are to engage in direct search behaviors (e.g., direct visits) rather than indirect ones (e.g., search engine inquiries). We also study the effects of various types of display advertising (e.g., prospecting, retargeting, affiliate targeting, video advertising, etc.) and the different goals they achieve. Our framework for evaluating display advertising effectiveness constitutes a stepping stone toward causally addressing the digital attribution problem."	sv7a3bjpxf	"TOWARD A DIGITAL ATTRIBUTION MODEL: MEASURING THE IMPACT OF DISPLAY ADVERTISING ON ONLINE CONSUMER BEHAVIOR."

"Marketing resource allocation has been a topic of intense scrutiny, yet the literature on the topic has not paid adequate attention to the fact that the effectiveness of marketing-mix elements varies over time. Despite the fact that firms collect volumes of data on their customers, existing estimation approaches do not readily lend themselves to modeling the temporal variations for big data and provide little guidance to managers in terms of their resource allocation decisions. We address this gap and argue that marketing-mix effectiveness varies with the evolution of the consumer–brand relationship and explicitly model these temporal variations using a time-varying effects model (TVEM) that accounts for self-selection of customers into receiving marketing communications and endogeneity of the number of such communications. The proposed TVEM framework handles the complexities associated with big data analytics and provides novel insights for data-driven decision making. We combine transaction data from a Fortune 500 retailer with demographic information obtained from Acxiom Corp for over a quarter million customers to test our framework. The results provide strong support for our proposed framework. Specifically, we find that the influence of marketing mailers, other transaction characteristics (coupon redemption, returns, and cross-buy), and demographic factors (age, income, household size, and interests) on sales varies significantly over the customer life cycle and ignoring such temporal variations can lead to gross misallocation of marketing investments. Specifically, our results suggest that firms can increase their revenues by over 17 percent by just reallocating their resources based on the proposed framework. To facilitate adoption of our proposed framework, we provide guidance and actionable insights for managerial relevance."	crveg3updf	"USING BIG DATA TO MODEL TIME-VARYING EFFECTS FOR MARKETING RESOURCE (RE)ALLOCATION."
"In this paper, we introduce a tree-based approach adjusting for observable self-selection bias in intervention studies in management research. In contrast to traditional propensity score (PS) matching methods, including those using classification trees as a subcomponent, our tree-based approach provides a standalone, automated, data-driven methodology that allows for (1) the examination of nascent interventions whose selection is difficult and costly to theoretically specify a priori, (2) detection of heterogeneous intervention effects for different preintervention profiles, (3) identification of pre-intervention variables that correlate with the self-selected intervention, and (4) visual presentation of intervention effects that is easy to discern and understand. As such, the tree-based approach is a useful tool for analyzing observational impact studies as well as for post-analysis of experimental data. The tree-based approach is particularly advantageous in the analyses of big data, or data with large sample sizes and a large number of variables. It outperforms PS in terms of computational time, data loss, and automatic capture of nonlinear relationships and heterogeneous interventions. It also requires less user specification and choices than PS, reducing potential data dredging. We discuss the performance of our method in the context of such big data and present results for very large simulated samples with many variables. We illustrate the method and the insights it yields in the context of three impact studies with different study designs: reanalysis of a field study on the effect of training on earnings, analysis of the impact of an electronic governance service in India based on a quasi-experiment, and performance comparison of contract pricing mechanisms and durations in IT outsourcing using observational data."	knsm46urej	"A TREE-BASED APPROACH FOR ADDRESSING SELF-SELECTION IN IMPACT STUDIES WITH BIG DATA."

"In this paper, we develop conjectures for understanding how information technology (IT) strategy and IT investments jointly influence profitability and the market value of the firm. We view IT strategy as an expression of the dominant strategic objective that the firm chooses to emphasize, which can be revenue expansion, cost reduction, or a dual emphasis in which both goals are pursued. Using data from more than 300 firms in the United States, we find that at the mean value of IT investments, firms with a dual IT strategic emphasis have a higher market value as measured by Tobin's Q than firms with a revenue or a cost emphasis, but they have similar levels of profitability. Of greater importance, IT strategic emphasis plays a significant role in moderating the relationship between IT investments and firm performance. Dual-emphasis firms have a stronger IT–Tobin's Q relationship than revenue-emphasis firms. Dual-emphasis firms also have a stronger IT– profitability relationship than either revenue- or cost-emphasis firms. Overall, these findings imply that, at low levels of IT investment, the firm may need to choose between revenue expansion and cost reduction, but at higher levels of IT investment, dual-emphasis in IT strategy or IT strategic ambidexterity increasingly pays off."	4ebjjidfp5	"HOW INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY AND INVESTMENTS INFLUENCE FIRM PERFORMANCE: CONJECTURE AND EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE1."
"Despite a general consensus that use of information technology (IT) is an important link between IT investments and performance, the extant literature provides only a limited explanation as to when the use of IT lifts performance. We posit that the impact of knowledge management systems (KMS) usage is contingent on users' alternative sources of knowledge as well as their specific task environments. We investigate under what conditions repository KMS use leads to higher performance outcomes in a retail grocery context. We use a unique longitudinal dataset composed of objective measures of KMS use and sales performance of 273 managers over 146 weeks collected from a retail grocery chain. We obtain two main results. First, we find a diminishing impact of KMS use for managers who also use other sources of codified knowledge, namely physical or computerized alternative knowledge sources, whereas a complementary relationship seems to exist between KMS use and social sources of knowledge. Second, KMS use produces higher benefits for managers whose task environments require a greater volume of information and knowledge, but smaller benefits for those managers whose task environments demand rapidly changing information and knowledge. Our work contributes to both the IT business value and the KM literature by studying the contingent impact of IT usage while broadening the theoretical scope of the situated knowledge performance framework with a critical empirical test based on fine-grained objective and longitudinal data."	efmch46nqz	"WHEN DOES REPOSITORY KMS USE LIFT PERFORMANCE?

"This paper examines multiple contract design choices in the context of transaction and relational attributes and consequent ex ante and ex post transaction costs. It focuses on two understudied themes in the IT outsourcing literature. First, while the literature is predominantly concerned with opportunism and consequent ex post hazard costs that contracts can safeguard against, parties to a contract also economize on ex ante transaction costs by their choice of contract type and contract extensiveness. Second, the literature studies the aggregate extensiveness of contracts rather than of distinct contract functions: safeguarding, coordination, and adaptability. Against this backdrop, our research model portrays a nuanced picture that is anchored in the following theoretical interpretation: transaction and relational attributes have implications on specific ex ante and ex post transaction costs, and these implications can be balanced by respective choices in both contract type and the extensiveness of specific contract functions. These two contract design choices complement and substitute for each other in their ability to economize on specific transaction costs. Our analysis of 210 software development outsourcing contracts finds that explanatory power increases when analyzing the extensiveness of individual contract functions rather than the aggregate contract extensiveness, highlighting subtle competing influences that are otherwise masked by an aggregate measure. Our analysis also shows that a preference for time-and-material contracts counteracts the effect of certain transaction attributes on contract extensiveness, and even cancels it out in the case of transaction uncertainty."	lp3ruflpij	"CONTRACT DESIGN CHOICES AND THE BALANCE OF EX ANTE AND EX POST TRANSACTION COSTS IN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT OUTSOURCING1."
"Knowledge sourcing strategy (KSS) is regarded as a key determinant of successful Knowledge Management (KM). However, prior research on how KSSs can improve firm performance has produced inconsistent results. This may be due to inadequate consideration of complementary and substitutable relationships in KSSs. Whereas previous studies have assessed the impact of individual KSS on firm performance, in practice firms adopt several different KSSs simultaneously. Drawing on the Knowledge-based View (KBV) and the complementarity theory, this study investigates the impact of multiple KSSs, in terms of sourcing type and origin, to develop three sets of hypotheses on complementarity and substitutability. Survey data collected from 372 firms in Korea are analyzed to test the hypotheses using the supermodularity and submodularity functions. The results confirm complementary relationships between system- and external-oriented, between person- and internal-oriented, and among system-, person-, and internal-oriented strategies, as well as substitutable relationships between person- and external-oriented strategies. Interestingly, different knowledge sourcing patterns between knowledge intensive and non-knowledge intensive environments are revealed. This study expands KM research by developing a new conceptual framework of KSSs and employing advanced analytical approaches to explore the relationships between KSSs and firm performance. It also offers valuable practical suggestions for managers in selecting successful combinations of KSSs using a judicious combination of system- and external-oriented, of person- and internal-oriented, or of system-, person-, and internal-oriented strategies."	skb446xlh5	"Complementarities and Substitutabilities Among Knowledge Sourcing Strategies and Their Impact on Firm Performance."
"Challenging conventional wisdom, we unravel three paradoxes of word of mouth (WOM) in e-commerce. Specifically,the WOM valence paradoxcontends that higher WOM valence of a product results in a larger subsequent decrease in the WOM valence of the product,the WOM volume paradoxpropounds that higher WOM volume of a product results in a smaller subsequent increase in the WOM volume of the product, andthe WOM spillover paradoxproposes that an improvement in the WOM of a product also improves the WOM of connected products in a product network. These paradoxes caution online retailers that superior WOM may at times backfire and not boost further sales. Drawing theoretical support from expectation-confirmation theory and network theory, we collect data from China’s largest business-to-consumer platform, Tmall.com, and use linear panel data models to examine WOM evolution in a product network, controlling for relevant factors at the individual product, product network, and time unit levels. Importantly, we base our identification strategies on the use of <mark>instrumental</mark> variables and the difference-in-differences estimation approach.

"Recent years have witnessed an unprecedented explosion in <mark>information</mark> technology that enables dynamic diffusion of user-generated content in social networks. Online videos, in particular, have changed the landscape of marketing and entertainment, competing with premium content and spurring business innovations. In the present study, we examine how learning and network effects drive the diffusion of online videos. While learning happens through informational externalities, network effects are direct payoff externalities. Using a unique data set from YouTube, we empirically identify learning and network effects separately, and find that both mechanisms have statistically and economically significant effects on video views; furthermore, the mechanism that dominates depends on the video type. Specifically, although learning primarily drives the popularity of quality-oriented content, network effects also make it possible for attention-grabbing content to go viral. Theoretically, we show that, unlike the diffusion of movies, it is the combination of both learning and network effects that generate the multiplier effect for the diffusion of online videos. From a managerial perspective, providers can adopt different strategies to promote their videos accordingly, that is, signaling the quality or featuring the viewer base depending on the video type. Our results also suggest that YouTube can play a much greater role in encouraging the creation of original content by leveraging the multiplier effect."	julasxix7n	"Two Formulas for Success in Social Media: Learning and Network Effects."
"Advances in <mark>information</mark> technology bring changes to the nature of work by facilitating companies to go beyond the wisdom of their workforce and tap into the “wisdom of the crowd” via online crowdsourcing contests. In these contests, active and motivated individuals collaborate in the form of self-organized teams that compete for rewards. Using a rich data set of 732 teams in 52 contests collected from the crowdsourcing platform, Kaggle.com, from its launch in April 2010 to July 2012, we studied how the allocation of members’ social and intellectual capital within a virtual team affects team performance in online crowdsourcing contests. Our econometric analysis uses a rank-ordered logistic regression model, and suggests that the effect of a member’s social and intellectual capital on team performance varies depending on his or her roles. Though a team leader’s social capital and a team expert’s intellectual capital significantly influence team performance, a team leader’s intellectual capital and a team expert’s social capital do not. Further, we found that the alignment of a member’s social and intellectual capital within a team has a significant influence on team performance. Moreover, the intensity of the competition moderates the impact. When a contest is highly competitive, the social and intellectual capital alignment negatively affects team performance, and when the competitive intensity is low, this alignment positively affects team performance. Our findings provide insights into improving performance in team-based competitions in crowdsourcing communities."	pm65gr2zwr	"Task Division for Team Success in Crowdsourcing Contests: Resource Allocation and Alignment Effects."
"We study how the knowledge that software developers receive from other software developers in their company impacts their performance. We also study the boundary conditions of this relationship. The results of our empirical study indicate that receiving knowledge from other software developers in the company is positively related to the performance of the knowledge-receiving software developers. Moreover, this relationship was stronger when the software developers had high rather than low task autonomy, when they had high- rather than low-quality social exchanges with their supervisors, and when the software development firms used formal knowledge utilization processes. Theoretically, these results contribute to a better understanding of the processes through which software developers utilize the knowledge that they receive from their peers in the firm. Practically, they show software development firms how emphasizing the task, social, and institutional dimensions of the software development process can help them increase knowledge utilization and performance in software development."	kx2bhl5yfn	"Contextualized Relationship Between Knowledge Sharing and Performance in Software Development."
"Motivated by the wide dispersion in the returns on the use of <mark>information</mark> technology (IT) across industries, we conduct an industry-level examination of IT return and risk, focusing on the moderating role of industry competition, regulation, and technological change. We address the following research questions: What is the impact of IT investment on the return and risk dimensions of industry financial performance? How do industry characteristics moderate the relationship between IT investment and industry performance? Our analysis of these questions finds that higher levels of industry competition are associated with higher IT productivity (contribution of IT to value-added output), lower IT profitability (contribution of IT to industry average return on assets [ROA]), and higher IT risk (contribution of IT to ex ante variability of ROA). This is consistent with the notion that competition induces riskier IT investments, despite the fact that returns tend to be competed away. Higher levels of industry regulation are associated with lower IT returns in both productivity and profitability, but also lower IT risk. Finally, a higher rate of technological change induces both higher IT returns and higher IT risk. A variety of tests indicate that our results are robust. Our results shed light on factors that drive variation in IT performance across industries, and provide useful industry-level performance benchmarks of the return and risk impacts of IT investments."	rfkl2o6myv	"Industry-Level Analysis of <mark>Information</mark> Technology Return and Risk: What Explains the Variation?"

Since price is typically endogenous in any supply demand system, we used the exogenous variation of the normalized exchange rate of the currency among countries, as a 'cost-shifter' type <mark>instrumental</mark> <mark>variable</mark> (IV) for econometric identification. Our panel data analyses results (both with and without IV) show that buyers are negatively affected by country differences in terms of language, time zone, and culture, and prefer service providers from countries with higher IT development. Notably, the reputation of service providers attenuates the negative effects of language and cultural (but not time zone) differences, while it substitutes the positive effect of the country's IT development. We discuss the study's theoretical and managerial implications for understanding the global dynamics of online outsourcing platforms and better designing these platforms.

"We empirically examine the impact of expanded product variety on demand concentration using large data sets from the movie rental industry as our test bed. We find that product variety is likely to increase demand concentration, which goes against the 'long tail effect' theory predicting that demand will become less concentrated on 'hit' products because of expanded product variety. We further provide evidence that this finding is not due to introducing many low-selling niche products, as the intuition might suggest. Instead, we discover that increasing product variety diversifies the demand away from each movie title, but less significantly for hits than for niche products. In particular, we find that increasing product variety by 1,000 titles may increase the Gini coefficient of DVD rentals by 0.0029, which translates to increasing the market share of the top 1% of DVDs by 1.96% and the market share of the top 10% of DVDs by 0.58%. At the same time, the market share of the bottom 1% of DVDs is reduced by 21.29%, while the market share of the bottom 10% of DVDs is reduced by 5.28%. We rule out alternative explanations using a variety of long tail metrics, capturing movie format/distribution channel interaction and customer heterogeneity, while making use of <mark>instrumental</mark> variables."	up5fzpgkd5	"Is Tom Cruise Threatened?

"We study social influence in an online music community. In this community, users can listen to and 'favorite' (or like) songs and follow the favoriting behavior of their social network friends-and the community as a whole. From an individual user's perspective, two types of <mark>information</mark> on peer consumption are salient for each song: total number of favorites by the community as a whole and favoriting by their social network friends. Correspondingly, we study two types of social influence: popularity influence, driven by the total number of favorites from the community as a whole, and proximity influence, due to the favoriting behavior of immediate social network friends. Our quasi-experimental <mark>research</mark> design applies a variety of empirical methods to highly granular data from an online music community. Our analysis finds robust evidence of both popularity and proximity influence. Furthermore, popularity influence is more important for narrow-appeal music compared to broad-appeal music. Finally, the two types of influence are substitutes for one another, and proximity influence, when available, dominates the effect of popularity influence. We discuss implications for design and marketing strategies for online communities, such as the one studied in this paper."	juccomuabr	"Popularity or Proximity: Characterizing the Nature of Social Influence in an Online Music Community."
"Prior <mark>research</mark> at the firm level finds <mark>information</mark> technology (IT) to be a net substitute for both labor and non-IT capital inputs. However, it is unclear whether these results hold, given recent IT innovations and continued price declines. In this study we extend prior <mark>research</mark> to examine whether these input relationships have evolved over time. First, we introduce new price indexes to account for varying technological progress across different types of IT hardware. Second, we use the rental price methodology to measure capital in terms of the flow of services provided. Finally, we use hedonic methods to extend our IT measures to 1998, enabling analysis spanning the emergence of the Internet. Analyzing approximately 9,800 observations from over 800 Fortune 1,000 firms for the years 1987-1998, we find firm demand for IT to be elastic for decentralized IT and inelastic for centralized IT. Moreover, Allen Elasticity of Substitution estimates confirm that through labor substitution, the increasing factor share of IT comes at the expense of labor. Last, we identify a complementary relationship between IT and ordinary capital, suggesting an evolution in this relationship as firms have shifted to more decentralized organizational forms. We discuss these results in terms of prior <mark>research</mark>, suggest areas of future <mark>research</mark>, and discuss managerial implications."	hti44wdyij	"Does Technological Progress Alter the Nature of <mark>Information</mark> Technology as a Production Input?

"A key aspect of better and more secure software is timely patch release by software vendors for the vulnerabilities in their products. Software vulnerability disclosure, which refers to the publication of vulnerability <mark>information</mark>, has generated intense debate. An important consideration in this debate is the behavior of software vendors. How quickly do vendors patch vulnerabilities and how does disclosure affect patch release time? This paper compiles a unique data set from the Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination Center (CERT) and SecurityFocus to answer this question. Our results suggest that disclosure accelerates patch release. The instantaneous probability of releasing the patch rises by nearly two and a half times because of disclosure. Open source vendors release patches more quickly than closed source vendors. Vendors are more responsive to more severe vulnerabilities. We also find that vendors respond more slowly to vulnerabilities not disclosed by CERT. We verify our results by using another publicly available data set and find that results are consistent. We also show how our estimates can aid policy makers in their decision making.

"This paper examines the effect of the freemium strategy on Google Play, an online marketplace for Android mobile applications. By analyzing a large panel data set consisting of 711 ranked mobile apps, we found that the freemium strategy is positively associated with increased sales of the paid mobile apps. Positive trial experience as represented by high review rating of the free version of a mobile app leads to higher sales of its paid version, whereas high visibility of the free version of a mobile app as represented by its product rank does not have a significant impact on the sales of its paid version. This finding suggests that although offering a free trial version is a viable way to improve the visibility of a mobile app, offering a quality free app is more important in boosting sales of the paid app. Moreover, we found that the impact of review rating is reduced when the free version is offered, or when the mobile app is a hedonic app, because consumers have the ability to experience the app themselves before purchase. These findings extend understanding of the freemium business model to include a market characterized by simultaneous intramarket competition for both the freemium and paid products and demonstrate how such dynamics may influence sales of the paid products."	4k3joxqivj	"Effects of Freemium Strategy in the Mobile App Market: An Empirical Study of Google Play."
"While profitable business models elude many virtual worlds, sales of virtual products are a potentially lucrative source of revenue. One new addition to this strategy is virtual gifting, whereby users purchase virtual products to give to other users. The monetary value of such virtual good transactions is economically significant but no prior study has examined this phenomenon in a strictly virtual context. We apply theory from the economics literature to examine gifting behavior in a virtual world in which users' social status is reflected in observable social connections (friendships) and interactions (personal messages). We find strong evidence that gifting is associated with future enhancements of the gift giver's social status, consistent with a social status-seeking motivation, thus confirming a theorized behavior that is difficult to study in the real world. Our study has implications for system proprietors and managers because we show that gift giving increases system use continuance. We identify various antecedents of gift giving, which may assist a manager in identifying users who are most inclined to give gifts and enable the manager to signal the social exchange benefits to users as a way of improving their social connections."	yndoilmikz	"Gifting and Status in Virtual Worlds."
"Product sales via sponsored keyword advertising on search engines rely on an effective selection of keywords that describe the offerings. In this study, we consider both the direct sales of the advertised products and indirect sales (i.e., cross-selling) of other products, and examine how specific keywords and general keywords influence these two types of sales differently. We also examine how the cross-selling effects may vary across different types of products (main products and accessories). Our results suggest that the use of specific keywords leans toward improving the direct sales of advertised products, while the use of general keywords leans toward improving the indirect sales of other products. The contribution of keywords to indirect sales is influenced by product type. For main products, the use of specific keywords generates a higher marginal contribution to indirect sales than that of general keywords. For accessory products, the use of general keywords generates a higher marginal contribution to indirect sales than that of specific keywords. The key implication of this study is that sellers focusing on different types of sales (direct or indirect sales) or products (main or accessory products) should consider using different types of keywords in search engine advertising to drive sales."	ba3m33lcqf	"Differential Effects of Keyword Selection in Search Engine Advertising on Direct and Indirect Sales."

"Giving away trial software is a common practice for software developers to maximize the exposure of their products to potential consumers and to minimize the consumers' uncertainty about software quality. There are two types of free trials: (1) freeware, which consists of very basic features of focal software without a time lock, and (2) trialware, which has the full functionality of focal software with a time lock. In this paper, we study what factors make some free-trial software attract more potential adopters than others. Our empirical model under the traditional Bass-type diffusion examines the effects of the different types of free-trial software and ratings on consumer software sampling and reveals the dynamics of sampling over time. Using free-trial software downloading data on Download.com, we observe that the consumer software sampling process can be described by the theory of <mark>information</mark> diffusion. We find that user ratings affect sampling performance positively and that third-party ratings need to be positive to be effective. Finally, our results do not show any discernible differences between freeware and trialware with regard to their impact on sampling performance. This study contributes to the understanding of software free-trial practice from the perspective of consumer sampling growth of different types of free trials. Our findings can help design free-trial strategies to extrapolate the extent of consumer awareness of focal software and effectively convey its quality <mark>information</mark> to potential customers."	btik65dldb	"Effects of Different Types of Free Trials and Ratings in Sampling of Consumer Software: An Empirical Study."
"This study investigates the development and sustainability of a firm's <mark>information</mark> technology (IT) capability reputation from an IT executive's standpoint. Building on institutional theory, we argue that IT executives will try to achieve external legitimacy (i.e., project an image of superior IT capability to external stakeholders) in the hope that the top management team and board members will reciprocate by elevating the internal legitimacy of IT executives. Firms that develop such a culture of reciprocity with their IT executives are more likely to sustain their IT capability reputation. Econometric results based on panel data for 1,326 large U.S. firms from a wide spectrum of industries over a 13-year period (1997-2009) validate these predictions. More specifically, we find that IT executives with greater structural power (e.g., higher job titles) or IT-related expert power (e.g., IT-related education or experience) are more likely to attract public recognition for their firm's IT capability. Firms that build such an IT capability reputation are more likely to promote their IT executives, and IT executives who are promoted are more likely to stay longer with their firms. This continuity in IT strategic leadership is positively associated with the firm's ability to sustain its IT capability reputation. Our findings have important practical implications related to a firm's IT reputation strategy as well as the motivation and career of IT executives. Firms wanting to develop and sustain their IT capability reputation would do well to foster the creation of a cycle of positive reciprocity with their IT executives. IT executives hoping to increase their power within their firm's top management team and improve the legitimacy of the firm's IT organization need to project an image of IT superiority to external stakeholders."	tnadlkku3r	"Sustainability of a Firm's Reputation for <mark>Information</mark> Technology Capability: The Role of Senior IT Executives."
"A host of different types of <mark>information</mark> goods are available for free download from illegal file sharing sites. As far as price is concerned, no company can compete against \"free.\" Hence, managers, researchers, and policy makers are interested in determining factors other than price that might influence consumers' file sharing behavior. Moral consideration is one factor that might sway individuals to pay for files they could otherwise obtain for free. To help better understand how moral consideration works in the context of file sharing, this research examines how people form perceptions of the legality and ethicalness of downloading music files through file sharing. We propose that when people receive files in a more restrictive manner (e.g. streaming vs. downloading) they are less likely to recognize file sharing as being unethical or illegal. We conduct five studies to test our theory of restrictiveness. The results consistently indicate that consumers' perceptions of legality and ethicalness of file sharing are associated with restrictiveness of use. In particular, while file sharing with different levels of restrictiveness still transfers intellectual property from one individual to another, increased restrictiveness results in consumers being less likely to identify file sharing as being illegal or unethical. This in turn has a great impact on their actual engagement in the unauthorized file sharing activities. We find the relationships are significant even when controlling for several other elements such as gender, age, income, and prior knowledge about how and where to go on the internet to participate in file sharing."	ulbuu3qnhv	"The Role of Restrictiveness of Use in Determining Ethical and Legal Awareness of Unauthorized File Sharing."
"Price dispersion is an important indicator of market efficiency. Internet-based electronic markets have the potential to reduce transaction and search costs, thereby creating more efficient, \"frictionless\" markets, as predicted by theories in <mark>information</mark> economics. However, earlier work has reported significant levels of price dispersion on the Internet, which is in contrast to theoretical predictions. A key feature of the existing stream of work has been its use of posted prices to estimate price dispersion. In theory, this can lead to an overestimation of price dispersion because a sale may not have occurred at the posted price. In this <mark>research</mark>, we use a unique data set of actual transaction prices collected from both the electronic and offline markets of buyers in a business-to-business market to evaluate the extent of price dispersion. We find that price dispersion in the electronic market is as low as 0.22%, which is substantially less than that reported in the existing literature. This near-zero price dispersion suggests that in some electronic markets the \"law of one price\" can prevail when we consider transaction prices, instead of posted prices. We further develop a theoretical framework that identifies several new drivers of price dispersion using transaction data. In particular, we focus on four product-level and market-level attributes-product cost, order cycle time, own price elasticity, and transaction quantity, and we estimate their impact on price dispersion. We also examine the electronic market's moderating role in the relationship between these drivers and price dispersion. Finally, we estimate the efficiency gains that accrue from transactions in the relatively friction-free market and find that the electronic market can enhance consumer surplus by as much as $97.92 million per year."	xvry7mwq7r	"Using Transaction Prices to Re-Examine Price Dispersion in Electronic Markets."

"Our <mark>research</mark> examines the impact of competing ads on click performance of an ad in sponsored search. We use a unique data set of 1,267 advertiser keyword pairs with differing ad quality related to 360 keywords from a search engine to evaluate the click performance. We find that competing high-quality ads, appearing above the focal ad, have a lower negative effect on the click performance as compared to competing low-quality ads. We also find that this effect of competing ads varies with the ad position and the type of keyword. In general, the negative effect of competing high-quality ads decreases at low positions as compared to high positions. Furthermore, this decrease in the negative effect of competing high-quality ads is more substantial for specific keywords. Our results reveal consumer behavior in evaluating different quality ads in sponsored search. More specifically, our results suggest that consumers use the presence of high-quality competing ads as a signal of higher quality of the focal ad. Our findings can help advertisers better evaluate their relative performance for different positions for various types of keywords. This can also help evaluate the efficacy of the auction design mechanism."	d3upin3g5f	"The Impact of Competing Ads on Click Performance in Sponsored Search."
"Individuals' actions in online social contexts are growing increasingly visible and traceable.

"Logistics outsourcing has increased with the commercialization of the Internet, implying a reduction in the corresponding transaction costs. The Internet-with its universal connectivity and open standards-radically enhanced <mark>information</mark> technology (IT) capabilities, and we hypothesize this has reduced external transaction costs relatively more than internal governance costs. Using transaction cost theory as a lens, we examine whether the commercialization of the Internet coincided with a move to the market in logistics-one of the most connected industries in the economy. We estimate the relationship between IT and outsourced logistics in a production function based on two data sets from 1987 to 2008. We find that the effects of IT on outsourced logistics have changed in the post-Internet era. After the commercialization of the Internet, an industry's own IT investment and outsourced logistics became complements, whereas they were not before. It suggests that because of the unique characteristics of the Internet as an enabler, IT reduced external transaction costs relatively more than internal governance costs. Consequently, industries favored the market form of the provision of logistics. We also find similar impacts of customers' IT investments on a focal industry's outsourced logistics. Previous studies argued that IT led to the shift from hierarchies to markets, or provided indirect evidence through measures of firm size or integration. Using a production theory model, our study provides systematic empirical evidence to support that the Internet enabled a move to the market in the provision of logistics."	fxlrej3rkz	"<mark>Research</mark> Note-An Internet-Enabled Move to the Market in Logistics."
"This study examines cloud computing spot pricing dynamics and the influence of latency on those pricing dynamics. Using the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud U.S. East and West market spot instance pricing and latency intraday data from April 9, 2010, to May 22, 2011, we find considerable time variation in spot instance prices, and prices are often persistently higher in the West. Bivariate vector autoregressive model results show that within-market autoregressive pricing effects are larger than across-market effects. We also document that over 70% of the relative price discovery occurs in the East market. Our regression results further show that East-West latency differentials have a significantly positive effect on East-West pricing differentials. Latency creates a dynamic pricing wedge that widens or narrows conditional on the latency differentials. Using an error correction model, the speed of adjustment from long-run pricing convergence errors causes the short-run price differential to narrow, but the adjustment does not completely offset the price differential."	ui7226kuxv	"Cloud Computing Spot Pricing Dynamics: Latency and Limits to Arbitrage."
"Online labor markets are Web-based platforms that enable buyers to identify and contract for <mark>information</mark> technology (IT) services with service providers using buyer-determined (BD) auctions. BD auctions in online labor markets either follow an open or a sealed bid format. We compare open and sealed bid auctions in online labor markets to identify which format is superior in terms of obtaining more bids and a higher buyer surplus. Our theoretical analysis suggests that the relative advantage of open versus sealed bid auctions hinges on the role of reducing service providers' valuation uncertainty (difficulty in assessing the cost to execute a project) and competition uncertainty (difficulty in assessing the intensity of the competition from other service providers), which largely depend on the relative importance of the common value (versus the private value) component of the auctioned IT services, calling for an empirical investigation to compare open and sealed bid auctions. Based on a unique data set of 71,437 open bid auctions and 7,499 sealed bid auctions posted by 21,799 buyers at a leading online labor market, we find that, on average, although sealed bid auctions attract 18.4% more bids, open bid auctions offer buyers $10.87 higher surplus. Furthermore, open bid auctions are 55.3% more likely to result in a buyer's selection of a certain service provider and 22.1% more likely to reach a contract (conditional on the buyer's making a selection) with a provider, and they generate higher buyer satisfaction. In contrast to conventional wisdom that \"the more bids the better\" and industry practice of treating sealed bid auctions as a premium feature, our results suggest that the buyer surplus gained from the reduction in valuation uncertainty enabled by open bid auctions outweighs the buyer surplus gained from the higher competition uncertainty in sealed bid auctions, which renders open bid auctions a superior auction design in online labor markets."	ikj5b7nq6b	"Comparing Open and Sealed Bid Auctions: Evidence from Online Labor Markets."

"Knowledge sourcing strategy (KSS) is regarded as a key determinant of successful Knowledge Management (KM). However, prior research on how KSSs can improve firm performance has produced inconsistent results. This may be due to inadequate consideration of complementary and substitutable relationships in KSSs. Whereas previous studies have assessed the impact of individual KSS on firm performance, in practice firms adopt several different KSSs simultaneously. Drawing on the Knowledge-based View (KBV) and the complementarity theory, this study investigates the impact of multiple KSSs, in terms of sourcing type and origin, to develop three sets of hypotheses on complementarity and substitutability. Survey data collected from 372 firms in Korea are analyzed to test the hypotheses using the supermodularity and submodularity functions. The results confirm complementary relationships between system- and external-oriented, between person- and internal-oriented, and among system-, person-, and internal-oriented strategies, as well as substitutable relationships between person- and external-oriented strategies. Interestingly, different knowledge sourcing patterns between knowledge intensive and non-knowledge intensive environments are revealed. This study expands KM research by developing a new conceptual framework of KSSs and employing advanced analytical approaches to explore the relationships between KSSs and firm performance. It also offers valuable practical suggestions for managers in selecting successful combinations of KSSs using a judicious combination of system- and external-oriented, of person- and internal-oriented, or of system-, person-, and internal-oriented strategies."	skb446xlh5	"Complementarities and Substitutabilities Among Knowledge Sourcing Strategies and Their Impact on Firm Performance."

The panel FMOLS and panel DOLS analyses show that internet usage has a significant and positive effect on economic well-being. The panel causality analysis shows that there is bi-directional causality between internet usage and economic well-being in the short and long run, meaning that internet usage plays significant roles in increasing economic well-being, and economic well-being also plays significant roles in the expansion of internet usage both in the short and long run. Interestingly, the study shows that internet scams have a significant and negative effect on economic well-being, meaning that growing internet scams lead to lower economic well-being in SSA."	ejxhy5m6gj	"Repositioning for Increased Digital Dividends: Internet Usage and Economic Well-being in Sub-Saharan Africa."

"Social influence has a great impact on human behavior, which has been widely investigated in various research fields. Even so, it has rarely been investigated in the online health community. In this paper, we focus on the multichannel access in online health communities, defining social influence as the average degree of multichannel access to a physician's colleagues. Based on the multinomial logistic regression model, we examined the direct effects of social influence and patients' rating to multichannel access. In addition, we explored the moderating effect of social influence on the relationship between patients' rating and multichannel access in online health communities. The results of the experiment and robustness testing support the propositions that social influence and patients' rating significantly and positively affect multichannel access in an online health community. The moderating effect of social influence is negative and significantly influences the accessible channels provided by the focal physician. This research contributes to the literature concerning online health communities, social influence, and multichannel access; it also has practical implications."	6fa2nmnvwj	"Exploring the Social Influence of Multichannel Access in an Online Health Community."
"Despite the evolving literature on the development benefits of mobile phones, we still know very little about factors that influence their adoption. Using 25 policy variables, we investigate determinants of mobile phone penetration in 49 Sub-Saharan African countries with data for the period 2000-2012. The empirical evidence is based on contemporary and non-contemporary OLS, Fixed Effects, System GMM, and Quantile Regression techniques. The determinants are classified into six policy categories. They are: (i) macroeconomic, (ii) business/bank, (iii) market-related, (iv) knowledge economy, (v) external flows, and (vi) human development. Results are presented in terms of threshold and non-threshold effects. The former has three main implications. &lt;italic&gt;First&lt;/italic&gt;, there are increasing positive benefits in regulation quality, human development, foreign investment, education, urban population density, and Internet penetration. &lt;italic&gt;Second&lt;/italic&gt;, there is evidence of decreasing positive effects from patent applications. &lt;italic&gt;Third&lt;/italic&gt;, increasing damaging influences are established for foreign aid and return on equity. Non-threshold tendencies are discussed. Policy implications are also covered with emphasis on policy syndromes to enhance more targeted implications for worst-performing nations."	wbakfc7eab	"Determinants of Mobile Phone Penetration: Panel Threshold Evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa."
"In this paper, we study the differential influence of online user-generated content (UGC), specifically blogs, across the multiple stages of decision making of venture capitalists: screening stage, choice stage, and contract stage. We conjecture that, first, blogs are influential at the screening stage; second, after the screening stage, blogs are noninfluential since decision makers evaluate entities closely at later stages; third, blogs increase the interest from multiple decision makers which in turn increases the cost of the deal for a decision maker. This empirical investigation provides support for the hypotheses, which we tested for funding decisions by venture capitalists in information technology ventures. In particular, this study indicates that blogs can help managers in getting their products/services selected at the screening stage, but, beyond that, blogs do not help directly. However, since more decision makers screen products/services that receive blog coverage, the competition among decision makers helps managers in negotiating better contract terms. We advance the boundary of existing studies on the influence of UGC from single stage process to multiple stages."	blyyxel5p5	"DIFFERENTIAL INFLUENCE OF BLOGS ACROSS DIFFERENT STAGES OF DECISION MAKING: THE CASE OF VENTURE CAPITALISTS."
"Does information technology outsourcing reduce non-IT operating costs? This study examines this question and also asks whether internal IT investments moderate the relationship between IT outsourcing and non-IT operating costs. Using a panel data set of approximately 300 U.S. firms from 1999 to 2003, we find that IT outsourcing has a significant negative association with firms' non-IT operating costs. However, this finding does not imply that firms should completely outsource their entire IT function. Our results suggest that firms benefit more in terms of reduction in non-IT operating costs when they also have higher levels of complementary investments in internal IT, especially IT labor. Investments in internal IT systems can make business processes more amenable to outsourcing, and complementary investments in internal IT staff can facilitate monitoring of vendor performance and coordination with vendors. We discuss the implications of these findings for further research and for practice."	fma7iw3qpr	"INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY OUTSOURCING AND NON-IT OPERATING COSTS: AN EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION."

"Motivated by the growing importance of social media, this paper examines the relationship between new media, old media, and sales in the context of the music industry. In particular, we study the interplay between blog buzz, radio play, and music sales at both the album and song levels of analysis. We employ the panel vector autoregression (PVAR) methodology, an extension of vector autoregression to panel data. We find that radio play is consistently and positively related to future sales at both the song and album levels. Blog buzz, however, is not related to album sales and negatively related to song sales, suggesting that sales displacement due to free online sampling dominates any positive word-of-mouth effects of song buzz on sales. Further, the negative relationship between song buzz and sales is stronger for niche music relative to mainstream music, and for less popular songs within albums. We discuss the implications of these results for both research and practice regarding the role of new media in the music industry."	kahsppz7cj	"SOCIAL MEDIA, TRADITIONAL MEDIA, AND MUSIC SALES."
"This paper examines the effect of the freemium strategy on Google Play, an online marketplace for Android mobile applications. By analyzing a large panel data set consisting of 711 ranked mobile apps, we found that the freemium strategy is positively associated with increased sales of the paid mobile apps. Positive trial experience as represented by high review rating of the free version of a mobile app leads to higher sales of its paid version, whereas high visibility of the free version of a mobile app as represented by its product rank does not have a significant impact on the sales of its paid version. This finding suggests that although offering a free trial version is a viable way to improve the visibility of a mobile app, offering a quality free app is more important in boosting sales of the paid app. Moreover, we found that the impact of review rating is reduced when the free version is offered, or when the mobile app is a hedonic app, because consumers have the ability to experience the app themselves before purchase. These findings extend understanding of the freemium business model to include a market characterized by simultaneous intramarket competition for both the freemium and paid products and demonstrate how such dynamics may influence sales of the paid products."	4k3joxqivj	"Effects of Freemium Strategy in the Mobile App Market: An Empirical Study of Google Play."
"While profitable business models elude many virtual worlds, sales of virtual products are a potentially lucrative source of revenue. One new addition to this strategy is virtual gifting, whereby users purchase virtual products to give to other users. The monetary value of such virtual good transactions is economically significant but no prior study has examined this phenomenon in a strictly virtual context. We apply theory from the economics literature to examine gifting behavior in a virtual world in which users' social status is reflected in observable social connections (friendships) and interactions (personal messages). We find strong evidence that gifting is associated with future enhancements of the gift giver's social status, consistent with a social status-seeking motivation, thus confirming a theorized behavior that is difficult to study in the real world. Our study has implications for system proprietors and managers because we show that gift giving increases system use continuance. We identify various antecedents of gift giving, which may assist a manager in identifying users who are most inclined to give gifts and enable the manager to signal the social exchange benefits to users as a way of improving their social connections."	yndoilmikz	"Gifting and Status in Virtual Worlds."
"Product sales via sponsored keyword advertising on search engines rely on an effective selection of keywords that describe the offerings. In this study, we consider both the direct sales of the advertised products and indirect sales (i.e., cross-selling) of other products, and examine how specific keywords and general keywords influence these two types of sales differently. We also examine how the cross-selling effects may vary across different types of products (main products and accessories). Our results suggest that the use of specific keywords leans toward improving the direct sales of advertised products, while the use of general keywords leans toward improving the indirect sales of other products. The contribution of keywords to indirect sales is influenced by product type. For main products, the use of specific keywords generates a higher marginal contribution to indirect sales than that of general keywords. For accessory products, the use of general keywords generates a higher marginal contribution to indirect sales than that of specific keywords. The key implication of this study is that sellers focusing on different types of sales (direct or indirect sales) or products (main or accessory products) should consider using different types of keywords in search engine advertising to drive sales."	ba3m33lcqf	"Differential Effects of Keyword Selection in Search Engine Advertising on Direct and Indirect Sales."
"Giving away trial software is a common practice for software developers to maximize the exposure of their products to potential consumers and to minimize the consumers' uncertainty about software quality. There are two types of free trials: (1) freeware, which consists of very basic features of focal software without a time lock, and (2) trialware, which has the full functionality of focal software with a time lock. In this paper, we study what factors make some free-trial software attract more potential adopters than others. Our empirical model under the traditional Bass-type diffusion examines the effects of the different types of free-trial software and ratings on consumer software sampling and reveals the dynamics of sampling over time. Using free-trial software downloading data on Download.com, we observe that the consumer software sampling process can be described by the theory of <mark>information</mark> diffusion. We find that user ratings affect sampling performance positively and that third-party ratings need to be positive to be effective. Finally, our results do not show any discernible differences between freeware and trialware with regard to their impact on sampling performance. This study contributes to the understanding of software free-trial practice from the perspective of consumer sampling growth of different types of free trials. Our findings can help design free-trial strategies to extrapolate the extent of consumer awareness of focal software and effectively convey its quality <mark>information</mark> to potential customers."	btik65dldb	"Effects of Different Types of Free Trials and Ratings in Sampling of Consumer Software: An Empirical Study."
"This study investigates the development and sustainability of a firm's <mark>information</mark> technology (IT) capability reputation from an IT executive's standpoint. Building on institutional theory, we argue that IT executives will try to achieve external legitimacy (i.e., project an image of superior IT capability to external stakeholders) in the hope that the top <mark>management</mark> team and board members will reciprocate by elevating the internal legitimacy of IT executives. Firms that develop such a culture of reciprocity with their IT executives are more likely to sustain their IT capability reputation. Econometric results based on panel data for 1,326 large U.S. firms from a wide spectrum of industries over a 13-year period (1997-2009) validate these predictions. More specifically, we find that IT executives with greater structural power (e.g., higher job titles) or IT-related expert power (e.g., IT-related education or experience) are more likely to attract public recognition for their firm's IT capability. Firms that build such an IT capability reputation are more likely to promote their IT executives, and IT executives who are promoted are more likely to stay longer with their firms. This continuity in IT strategic leadership is positively associated with the firm's ability to sustain its IT capability reputation. Our findings have important practical implications related to a firm's IT reputation strategy as well as the motivation and career of IT executives. Firms wanting to develop and sustain their IT capability reputation would do well to foster the creation of a cycle of positive reciprocity with their IT executives. IT executives hoping to increase their power within their firm's top <mark>management</mark> team and improve the legitimacy of the firm's IT organization need to project an image of IT superiority to external stakeholders."	tnadlkku3r	"Sustainability of a Firm's Reputation for <mark>Information</mark> Technology Capability: The Role of Senior IT Executives."
"Challenging conventional wisdom, we unravel three paradoxes of word of mouth (WOM) in e-commerce. Specifically,the WOM valence paradoxcontends that higher WOM valence of a product results in a larger subsequent decrease in the WOM valence of the product,the WOM volume paradoxpropounds that higher WOM volume of a product results in a smaller subsequent increase in the WOM volume of the product, andthe WOM spillover paradoxproposes that an improvement in the WOM of a product also improves the WOM of connected products in a product network. These paradoxes caution online retailers that superior WOM may at times backfire and not boost further sales. Drawing theoretical support from expectation-confirmation theory and network theory, we collect data from China’s largest business-to-consumer platform, Tmall.com, and use linear panel data models to examine WOM evolution in a product network, controlling for relevant factors at the individual product, product network, and time unit levels. Importantly, we base our identification strategies on the use of <mark>instrumental</mark> variables and the difference-in-differences estimation approach. Numerous statistical checks confirm the robustness and consistency of our findings. We contribute to a much richer theoretical understanding of WOM, by extending the applicability of expectation-confirmation theory and network theory to novel predictions and contexts, adding a dynamic perspective, unveiling three important WOM paradoxes, and offering practical insights."	jty3dsvud5	"The Paradoxes of Word of Mouth in Electronic Commerce."
"Recent years have witnessed an unprecedented explosion in <mark>information</mark> technology that enables dynamic diffusion of user-generated content in social networks. Online videos, in particular, have changed the landscape of marketing and entertainment, competing with premium content and spurring business innovations. In the present study, we examine how learning and network effects drive the diffusion of online videos. While learning happens through informational externalities, network effects are direct payoff externalities. Using a unique data set from YouTube, we empirically identify learning and network effects separately, and find that both mechanisms have statistically and economically significant effects on video views; furthermore, the mechanism that dominates depends on the video type. Specifically, although learning primarily drives the popularity of quality-oriented content, network effects also make it possible for attention-grabbing content to go viral. Theoretically, we show that, unlike the diffusion of movies, it is the combination of both learning and network effects that generate the multiplier effect for the diffusion of online videos. From a managerial perspective, providers can adopt different strategies to promote their videos accordingly, that is, signaling the quality or featuring the viewer base depending on the video type. Our results also suggest that YouTube can play a much greater role in encouraging the creation of original content by leveraging the multiplier effect."	julasxix7n	"Two Formulas for Success in Social Media: Learning and Network Effects."
"Advances in <mark>information</mark> technology bring changes to the nature of work by facilitating companies to go beyond the wisdom of their workforce and tap into the “wisdom of the crowd” via online crowdsourcing contests. In these contests, active and motivated individuals collaborate in the form of self-organized teams that compete for rewards. Using a rich data set of 732 teams in 52 contests collected from the crowdsourcing platform, Kaggle.com, from its launch in April 2010 to July 2012, we studied how the allocation of members’ social and intellectual capital within a virtual team affects team performance in online crowdsourcing contests. Our econometric analysis uses a rank-ordered logistic regression model, and suggests that the effect of a member’s social and intellectual capital on team performance varies depending on his or her roles. Though a team leader’s social capital and a team expert’s intellectual capital significantly influence team performance, a team leader’s intellectual capital and a team expert’s social capital do not. Further, we found that the alignment of a member’s social and intellectual capital within a team has a significant influence on team performance. Moreover, the intensity of the competition moderates the impact. When a contest is highly competitive, the social and intellectual capital alignment negatively affects team performance, and when the competitive intensity is low, this alignment positively affects team performance. Our findings provide insights into improving performance in team-based competitions in crowdsourcing communities."	pm65gr2zwr	"Task Division for Team Success in Crowdsourcing Contests: Resource Allocation and Alignment Effects."
"We study how the knowledge that software developers receive from other software developers in their company impacts their performance. We also study the boundary conditions of this relationship. The results of our empirical study indicate that receiving knowledge from other software developers in the company is positively related to the performance of the knowledge-receiving software developers. Moreover, this relationship was stronger when the software developers had high rather than low task autonomy, when they had high- rather than low-quality social exchanges with their supervisors, and when the software development firms used formal knowledge utilization processes. Theoretically, these results contribute to a better understanding of the processes through which software developers utilize the knowledge that they receive from their peers in the firm. Practically, they show software development firms how emphasizing the task, social, and institutional dimensions of the software development process can help them increase knowledge utilization and performance in software development."	kx2bhl5yfn	"Contextualized Relationship Between Knowledge Sharing and Performance in Software Development."
"Motivated by the wide dispersion in the returns on the use of <mark>information</mark> technology (IT) across industries, we conduct an industry-level examination of IT return and risk, focusing on the moderating role of industry competition, regulation, and technological change. We address the following research questions: What is the impact of IT investment on the return and risk dimensions of industry financial performance? How do industry characteristics moderate the relationship between IT investment and industry performance? Our analysis of these questions finds that higher levels of industry competition are associated with higher IT productivity (contribution of IT to value-added output), lower IT profitability (contribution of IT to industry average return on assets [ROA]), and higher IT risk (contribution of IT to ex ante variability of ROA). This is consistent with the notion that competition induces riskier IT investments, despite the fact that returns tend to be competed away. Higher levels of industry regulation are associated with lower IT returns in both productivity and profitability, but also lower IT risk. Finally, a higher rate of technological change induces both higher IT returns and higher IT risk. A variety of tests indicate that our results are robust. Our results shed light on factors that drive variation in IT performance across industries, and provide useful industry-level performance benchmarks of the return and risk impacts of IT investments."	rfkl2o6myv	"Industry-Level Analysis of <mark>Information</mark> Technology Return and Risk: What Explains the Variation?"
"Recent work has shown that a firm's plural sourcing strategy, which determines how much it chooses to make versus how much it chooses to buy, requires consideration of the complementarities and constraints that affect the differential advantages of making and buying. Elaborating on this perspective, we theorize how (<mark>mis</mark>)fit between a firm's plural sourcing strategy of simultaneously making and buying and its development of information technology (IT) enabled interfirm and intrafirm process integration capabilities influences firm performance in deregulated markets. We position our theory development and empirical tests in the context of the power-generation segment of the U.S. electric utility industry (EUI), an asset-intensive industry that has been deregulated to promote the separation of key value chain activities (i.e., generation, transmission, and distribution) and the development of wholesale energy markets. We draw on the transaction cost economics, coordination costs, and IT capabilities perspectives to theorize that a firm achieves fit (realizing performance benefits) by increasing market sourcing intensity (MSI)—or, how much it buys relative to how much it makes— and developing IT-enabled interfirm process integration capability for external coordination with the market, or misfit (realizing performance penalties) by increasing MSI and developing IT-enabled intrafirm process integration capability for coordinating internal production. We collated data from archival sources for 342 utility firms in the power-generation segment to construct a panel dataset for the period 1994-2004 on (1) firms' MSI from wholesale electricity markets, (2) firms' IT investment decisions to develop interfirm and intrafirm process integration capabilities, (3) measures of firm performance, and (4) several control variables related to exogenous shocks (i.e., regulatory change, oil crisis), region of operation, and firm-level factors. Our results suggest that fit between MSI and the development of IT-enabled interfirm process integration capability improves firm profitability, assessed by return on assets, and misfit between MSI and the development of IT-enabled intrafirm process integration capability extracts penalties in firm profitability. We also find evidence that fit between MSI and the development of IT-enabled interfirm process integration capability improves market valuation, assessed by Tobin's Q, and asset turnover, assessed by operating revenue/total assets. We discuss the implications of our findings for the development of IT capabilities to accompany a firm's plural sourcing strategy and the literature on IT business value."	6fg5a2g7wf	"FIT AND MISFIT OF PLURAL SOURCING STRATEGIES AND IT-ENABLED PROCESS INTEGRATION CAPABILITIES: CONSEQUENCES OF FIRM PERFORMANCE IN THE U.S. ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY."
"This article investigates software process diversity, defined as the project condition arising out of the simultaneous use of multiple software development process frameworks within a single project. Software process diversity is conceptualized as the response of a project team to such contingencies as requirements volatility, design and technological novelty, customer involvement, and the level of organizational process compliance enforced on the project. Moreover, we conceptualize that the degree of fit (or match) between a project's software process diversity and the level of process compliance enforced on the project impacts overall project performance. This conceptualization was empirically tested by utilizing data collected from 410 large commercial software projects of a multinational firm. The results show that higher levels of requirements volatility, design and technological novelty, and customer involvement increased software process diversity within a project. However, software process diversity decreased relative to increases in the level of process compliance enforced on the project. A higher degree of fit between the process diversity and process compliance of a project, rather than the effects of those variables independently, was found to be significantly associated with a higher level of project performance, as measured in terms of project productivity and software quality. These results indicate that increasing software process diversity in response to project-level contingencies improves project performance only when there is a concomitant increase in organizational process compliance efforts. The implications of these results for research are discussed and prescriptive guidelines derived to manage the fit between process diversity and process compliance for improving software project performance."	a25htkyeff	"SOFTWARE PROCESS DIVERSITY: CONCEPTUALIZATION, MEASUREMENT, AND ANALYSIS OF IMPACT ON PROJECT PERFORMANCE."
"This paper resumes the discussion in information systems research on the use of partial least squares (PLS) path modeling and shows that the inconsistency of PLS path coefficient estimates in the case of reflective measurement can have adverse consequences for hypothesis testing. To remedy this, the study introduces a vital extension of PLS: consistent PLS (PLSc). PLSc provides a correction for estimates when PLS is applied to reflective constructs: The path coefficients, inter-construct correlations, and indicator loadings become consistent. The outcome of a Monte Carlo simulation reveals that the bias of PLSc parameter estimates is comparable to that of covariance-based structural equation modeling. Moreover, the outcome shows that PLSc has advantages when using non-normally distributed data. We discuss the implications for IS research and provide guidelines for choosing among structural equation modeling techniques."	jwbqmxkj6z	"CONSISTENT PARTIAL LEAST SQUARES PATH MODELING."
"Managers make informed information technology investment decisions when they are able to quantify how IT contributes to firm performance. While financial accounting measures inform IT's influence on retrospective firm performance, senior managers expect evidence of how IT influences prospective measures such as the firm's market value. We examine the efficacy of IT's influence on firm value combined with measures of financial performance for non-publicly traded (NPT) hospitals that lack conventional market-based measures. We gathered actual sale transactions for NPT hospitals in the United States to derive the q ratio, a measure of market value. Our findings indicate that the influence of IT investment on the firm is more pronounced and statistically significant on firm value than exclusively on the accounting performance measures. Specifically, we find that the impact of IT investment is not significant on return on assets (ROA) and operating income for the same set of hospitals. This research note contributes to research and practice by demonstrating that the overall impact of IT is better understood when accounting measures are complemented with the firm's market value. Such market valuation is also critical in merger and acquisition decisions, an activity that is likely to accelerate in the healthcare industry. Our findings provide hospitals, as well as other NPT firms, with insights into the impact of IT investment and a pragmatic approach to demonstrating IT's contribution to firm value."	o7sdmyu5hb	"DOES INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT INFLUENCE A FIRM'S MARKET VALUE?

"Both theoretical and empirical evidence suggest that, in many markets with standards competition, network effects make the strong grow stronger and can \"tip\" the market toward a single, winner-take-all standard. We hypothesize, however, that low cost digital conversion technologies, which facilitate easy compatibility across competing standards, may reduce the strength of these network effects. We empirically test our hypotheses in the context of the digital flash memory card market. We first test for the presence of network effects in this market and find that network effects, as measured here, are associated with a significant positive price premium for leading flash memory card formats. We then find that the availability of digital converters reduces the price premium of the leading flash card formats and reduces the overall concentration in the flash memory market. Thus, our results suggest that, in the presence of low cost conversion technologies and digital content, the probability of market dominance can be lessened to the point where multiple, otherwise incompatible, standards are viable. Our conclusion that the presence of converters weakens network effects implies that producers of non-dominant digital goods standards benefit from the provision of conversion technology. Our analysis thus aids managers seeking to understand the impact of converters on market outcomes, and contributes to the existing literature on network effects by providing new insights into how conversion technologies can affect pricing strategies in these increasingly important digital settings."	anpqwjub3j	"STANDARDS COMPETITION IN THE PRESENCE OF DIGITAL CONVERSION TECHNOLOGY: AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF THE FLASH MEMORY CARD MARKET."
"It has been argued that platform technology owners cocreate business value with other firms in their platform ecosystems by encouraging complementary invention and exploiting indirect network effects. In this study, we examine whether participation in an ecosystem partnership improves the business performance of small independent software vendors (ISVs) in the enterprise software industry and how appropriability mechanisms influence the benefits of partnership. By analyzing the partnering activities and performance indicators of a sample of 1,210 small ISVs over the period 1996-2004, we find that joining a major platform owner's platform ecosystem is associated with an increase in sales and a greater likelihood of issuing an initial public offering(IPO). In addition, we show that these impacts are greater when ISVs have greater intellectual property rights or stronger downstream capabilities. This research highlights the value of interoperability between software products, and stresses that value cocreation and appropriation are not mutually exclusive strategies in interfirm collaboration."	jsbi2i4xtf	"COCREATION OF VALUE IN A PLATFORM ECOSYSTEM: THE CASE OF ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE."

"Personalization technologies today enable retailers to tailor online purchase interactions to the individual preferences and needs of customers. With personalization being increasingly perceived as a source of competitive advantage, there is a growing trend toward pursuing technology-enabled personalization strategies in online retailing. However, the choice of a retailer whether or not to select into technology-enabled personalization and its implications for customer loyalty are at best ambiguous. This paper is an attempt to resolve this apparent ambiguity. Specifically, the paper conceptualizes retailer selection into technology-enabled personalization strategies relevant to two steps of an online purchase, namely, transaction personalization strategy and decision personalization strategy, based on the operating characteristics of a retailer. The implications of the retailers' self-selection into technology-enabled personalization strategies for customer loyalty are then empirically investigated with data collected from 422 retailers. Further, based on a counterfactual analysis, the paper reveals the implications of making a normatively incorrect decision with respect to personalization strategy. Contrary to popular belief, the results of this study indicate that personalization may not be uniformly beneficial in terms of customer loyalty to all retailers. Although a majority of retailers pursue transaction personalization and realize benefits by way of improved customer loyalty, we find that the choice of a retailer to pursue decision personalization is self-selected and dependent on idiosyncratic characteristics related to its operating context. Retailers that have relatively large-scale operations, provide greater variety and realize higher customer satisfaction with product selection, and that do not necessarily compete on price (i.e., realize lower customer satisfaction with prices relative to competing retailers) are more likely to pursue the decision personalization strategy. Although some retailers pursue decision personalization because they clearly stand to benefit from doing so, other retailers are better off not following suit.

"The relationship between <mark>information</mark> technology (IT) and a key organizational design <mark>variable</mark>, firm size, is an important area of study, particularly given the ongoing transition to an <mark>information</mark>-based economy. To better understand the more nuanced aspects of the relationship, we formulated a bidirectional and time-lagged model that incorporates different perspectives from organizational theories and transaction cost economics. Our two models—the bidirectional and one-year lagged model and the bidirectional and two-year lagged model-were tested using nine-year panel data on IT spending, IT stock, coordination costs, firm size, and relevant control variables for 277 manufacturing firms. We found a sequential interaction between IT and firm size in both of the two models: as a firm grows in size, its coordination activities increase; the firm then uses more IT to handle the increased activities of coordination; this increased use of IT, in turn, decreases coordination costs, and eventually, the size of the firm decreases. It was also found that the presence of coordination costs is necessary for the sequential interaction between IT and firm size, indicating coordination between and within firms is a major reason for firms to invest in IT and for IT effect to take place on firm size. This study has taken an initial step by attempting to empirically examine dual causality and longitudinal effects between IT and firm size, and to reconcile different theoretical perspectives on the relationship between them. We hope this work can act as a catalyst for developing a better understanding of the complex relationship between IT and organizations, with the ultimate goal of offering robust prescriptions for successful structural change."	zntp2i3sdf	"Do Large Firms Become Smaller by Using <mark>Information</mark> Technology?"
"The content created by the users of social networking sites has reached such high levels of quality and variety that it is comparable to that produced by professional agencies. Therefore, understanding what types of content users generate and the underlying motivational factors is vital to the success of the sites. The extant <mark>research</mark> on content generation has primarily focused on the amount of content and on how to encourage participation in content creation, and less attention has been paid to the content itself and how social relations affect the types of content that users upload. This study aims to empirically document the relationship between social ties and the similarities between the types of content that people create online. We collected a large data set from the photo-hosting website Flickr detailing the users' social relations over time in conjunction with their photo-uploading behavior. We found that around the time of the formation of a social tie, members of dyads began to upload more similar photos than they did before that time. After a social tie was formed, this similarity evolved in different ways in different subgroups of dyads. Whereas the similarity between photos uploaded by dyads experiencing notably different popularity levels on the site continued to grow, the dyads of users with similar levels of popularity gradually began to upload less similar photos. In cultural production, individuals appear to present themselves as unique; this feature is more salient when the social contacts are similar in popularity status. Photo-shooting behaviors have been found to exhibit the same patterns. Furthermore, we show that the most divergent uploading behavior is observed when a high-popularity user initiates a tie with a user with lower popularity. We use social psychological motivations to explain these results."	3ljykut3dj	"Social Ties and User Content Generation: Evidence from Flickr."
"Given the demand for authentic personal interactions over social media, it is unclear how much firms should actively manage their social media presence. We study this question empirically in a health care setting. We show that active social media management drives more user-generated content. However, we find that this is due to an incremental increase in user postings from an organization's employees rather than from its clients. This result holds when we explore exogenous variation in social media policies, employees, and clients that are explained by medical marketing laws, medical malpractice laws, and distortions in Medicare incentives. Further examination suggests that content being generated mainly by employees can be avoided if a firm's postings are entirely client focused. However, most firm postings seem not to be specifically targeted to clients' interests, instead highlighting more general observations or achievements of the firm itself. We show that untargeted postings like these provoke activity by employees rather than clients. This may not be a bad thing because employee-generated content may help with employee motivation, recruitment, or retention, but it does suggest that social media should not be funded or managed exclusively as a marketing function of the firm."	qcvwbliv5r	"Active Social Media Management: The Case of Health Care."
"By studying the change in employees' network positions before and after the introduction of a social networking tool, I find that <mark>information</mark>-rich networks (low in cohesion and rich in structural holes), enabled by social media, have a positive effect on various work outcomes. Contrary to the notion that network positions are difficult to alter, I show that social media can induce a change in network structure, one from which individuals can derive economic benefits. In addition, I consider two intermediate mechanisms by which an <mark>information</mark>-rich network is theorized to improve work performance—<mark>information</mark> diversity and social communication—and quantify their effects on productivity and job security. Analysis shows that productivity, as measured by billable revenue, is more associated with <mark>information</mark> diversity than with social communication. However, the opposite is true for job security. Social communication is more correlated with reduced layoff risks than with <mark>information</mark> diversity. This, in turn, suggests that <mark>information</mark>-rich networks enabled through the use of social media can drive both work performance and job security, but that there is a trade-off between engaging in social communication and gathering diverse <mark>information</mark>."	gp56mbkuen	"Social Network Effects on Productivity and Job Security: Evidence from the Adoption of a Social Networking Tool."

"The measurement of the impact of IT spillovers on productivity is an important emerging area of <mark>research</mark>. Studies of IT spillovers often adopt a \"production function\" approach commonly used for measuring R&amp;D spillovers, in which an external pool of IT investment is modeled using weighted measures of the IT investments of other firms, industries, or countries. We show that when using this approach, measurement error in a firm's own IT inputs can exert a significant upward bias on estimates of social returns to IT investment. This problem is particularly severe for IT spillovers because of the high levels of measurement error in most available IT data. The presence of the bias term can be demonstrated by using <mark>instrumental</mark> <mark>variable</mark> techniques to remove the effects of measurement error in a firm's own IT inputs. Using panel data on IT investment, we show that measurement error corrected estimates of IT spillovers are 40% to 90% lower than uncorrected estimates. This bias term is increasing in the correlation between the IT pool and firms' own IT investment. Therefore, estimates from models of spillover pools are less sensitive to the issues identified in this paper when the spillover paths minimize the correlation between a firm's own IT investment and the constructed external IT pool. Implications for researchers, policy makers, and managers are discussed."	icjaddlv75	"Measuring <mark>Information</mark> Technology Spillovers."
"<mark>Information</mark> <mark>systems</mark> researchers have recently begun to propose models that include formatively specified constructs, and largely rely on partial least squares (PLS) to estimate the parameters of interest in those models.

"In this study, we estimate the effect of \"online following,\" a basic form of online social interaction, on members' contributions in open source software (OSS) communities, using a unique longitudinal data set containing <mark>information</mark> on over 4 million OSS developers and their social interactions over 7 years. We find that obtaining new followers in the previous month has a significant positive effect on developers' level of contribution in the current month. The effect carries over to the next month although the marginal effect decreases. We further find that the effect of new followers on their contribution level is much stronger for freelancers than those with company affiliation. In contrast to the previous literature that posited the existence of non-monetary incentives for developers who contribute to the OSS communities, our result suggests the existence of incentives that are tied to future monetary rewards for developers on these platforms. Our findings have important implications for the OSS platforms as well as the OSS community. OSS platform designers may consult our results to learn about the social features that affect members' contribution. We also encourage OSS community to use the \"following\" feature more prominently on OSS platforms to incentivize higher contribution levels to the projects."	g2hcwwhbwv	"Effect of \"Following\" on Contributions to Open Source Communities."
"Technology and media are delivering content that is transforming society. Providers must compete for consumer attention to sell their digital <mark>information</mark> goods effectively. This is challenging, since there is a high level of uncertainty associated with the consumption of such goods. Service providers often use free programming to share product <mark>information</mark>. We examine the effectiveness of content sampling strategy used for on-demand series dramas, a unique class of entertainment goods. The data were extracted from a large set of household video-on-demand (VoD) viewing records and combined with external data sources.

"We analyze the alignment between <mark>information</mark> processing needs and capacities. First, we explore the relationship between firms’ vertical and horizontal boundaries and <mark>information</mark> technology (IT) capabilities. The literature postulates that less internalization leads firms to invest more in <mark>information</mark> technology. However, we argue that the use of taper integration and diversification increases the demand for IT-based resources such as IT infrastructure and IT human resources. Second, we propose that the fit between <mark>information</mark> processing needs and capacity has a positive effect on performance.

One advantage of the data is that they include not only large firms but also small and medium-size manufacturers.

It also adds new evidence on the diversification–IT capabilities relationship and studies the consequences of alignment of corporate strategies and IT capabilities on firm performance.

"Motivated by the rise of social media platforms that achieve a fusion of content and community, we consider the role of word-of-mouth communications (WOM) structured through a network. Using a data set from YouTube, we examine how cascades of WOM interactions enhance the popularity of videos. We first estimate the impact of channel influence and other network parameters in initiating WOM communications. The probit estimation considers the selection effect in videos that are likely to be associated with a greater propensity to trigger WOM. We find that factors related to a channel’s ability to be a connector and a translator is most likely to result in the incidence of WOM. We then examine how cascades of WOM conversations have persistent impacts on subsequent video popularity. Empirically, the main issue here is heterogeneity in the epidemic potential of a video. Since the threshold might vary across videos, we use a finite mixture model. We also conduct a simultaneous estimation using latent <mark>instrumental</mark> variables to address endogeneity from unobservables.

"It is by now almost accepted as a stylized fact that offering deal promotion (such as via Groupon or LivingSocial) deteriorates local merchants’ online reputations (e.g., the average of Yelp review ratings). However, in this paper we show that the stylized fact is not true in certain circumstances. We theorize that the valence and volume of prior reviews can play an important moderating role in the effect of deal promotion. Empirically, we show that restaurants with a relatively low prior average rating and a relatively small review volume have improved their online reputations by offering Groupon promotion. The proportion of such restaurants is substantial. The findings are robust to multiple identification strategies and econometric specifications. The results underscore the substantial heterogeneity in the effect of deal promotion on local merchants’ online reputations. Merchants need to understand the moderating role of prior reviews (e.g., the valence and volume of prior reviews) and design appropriate strategies to maximize the returns from offering deal promotion."	ijwy5lyjbr	"Could Deal Promotion Improve Merchants’ Online Reputations?

"We explore the issue of seller differentiation in competitive auction environments, where most sellers have a high percentage of positive feedback. Analyzing a set of eBay auction listings for identical products, we find evidence that the use of visibility-enhancing and quality-signaling discretionary auction attributes affects auction outcomes throughout the auction process (i.e., listing views, bids, and price premiums). We also find strong evidence that the number of reputable sellers in an auction marketplace moderates the effects of these discretionary attributes on auction outcomes. Specifically, as auction environments become more competitive, these attributes become more effective tools for differentiation, whereas seller feedback scores become less effective. Furthermore, sellers appear to select their strategies for employing these discretionary attributes based on both their prior experience and the number of experienced reputable sellers in the market. These findings suggest that in addition to relying on feedback scores, online sellers must take a more strategic approach in the selection of discretionary attributes in their auction listings."	c7d4eq572n	"Seller Strategies for Differentiation in Highly Competitive Online Auction Markets."

However, organic competition helps the conversion performance of sponsored ads and leads to higher revenue. We also find that organic competition has a higher negative effect on click performance than does sponsored competition.

"Social networks have been shown to affect health. Because online social networking makes it easier for individuals to interact with experientially similar others in regard to health issues and to exchange social support, there has been an increasing effort to understand how networks function. Nevertheless, little attention has been paid to how these networks are formed. In this paper, we examine the driving forces behind patients' social network formation and evolution. We argue that patients' health-related traits influence their social connections and that the patients' network layout is shaped by their cognitive capabilities and their network embeddedness. By studying longitudinal data from 1,322 individuals and their communication ties in an online healthcare social network, we find that firsthand disease experience, which provides knowledge of the disease, increases the probability that patients will find experientially similar others and establish communication ties. Patients' cognitive abilities, including the <mark>information</mark> load that they can process and the range of social ties that they can manage, however, limit their network growth. In addition, we find that patients' efforts to reach out for additional social resources are associated with their embeddedness in the network and the cost of maintaining connections.

We employ a panel vector autoregression model to investigate the interrelationship between broadcasting promotions in social media and music sales, while controlling for influential factors such as advertising in traditional media channels, album prices, new music releases, user-generated content, and artist popularity. We characterize two types of broadcast messages in the MySpace context, personal and automated. We find that broadcasting in social media has a significant effect on sales even after controlling for the aforementioned factors, and more important, the effect mainly comes from personal messages rather than automated messages. We also show that the timing and content of personal messages play a role in affecting sales.

They find evidence of a statistically significant relationship between competitor UGC and viewership and of heterogeneity in the direction of these competitive relationships, positive in some time slots and negative in others. The predictive power of UGC for viewership is enhanced by 3% to 5% simply by incorporating competitors' UGC, in addition to a show's own UGC.

"<mark>Information</mark> technology (IT) services vendors operate in a highly competitive but also institutional environment that render their service-line offerings mutually observable. This suggests that imitation of rivals' decisions can be an efficient means for IT vendors when reconfiguring their service-line offerings. To explore how such imitation unfolds in this sector, we estimate a series of logistic regression models of 116 IT vendors' serviceline choices over three time periods. First, from the strategic imitation literature we identify the key imitation \"referents,\" which is a group of firms or a single firm with specific traits, and we test the relative influence of each referent. All of our analysis includes these referents as predictors of service-line choice. Next, we tested more nuanced models using theoretically guided subsamples as follows. One, based on <mark>information</mark> <mark>systems</mark> (IS) literature, we consider the IT vendors as embedded in three distinct \"institutional spheres,\" each corresponding to a knowledge domain, namely, technical, functional, and vertical industry domains. We separately examine imitation in each subsample corresponding to the three types of service lines. Two, based on strategy literature, we consider that the influence of the imitation referents differs when the choice under consideration is the addition of a new service line versus a withdrawal. Our results across all of these subsamples uncover a nuanced pattern of imitation that sometimes contrasts the full-sample results. The most prominent result is that although imitation is highly salient, the different imitation referents are not universally influential across all knowledge domains and between development versus withdrawal decisions. Specifically, the imitation of similar firms is widespread, whereas the imitation of largest firms or offering popular service-lines, which indicates bandwagon effects, are at play only selectively.

We use industry-level data to examine whether EL use with buyer and supplier industries helps reduce the bullwhip effect as measured by inventory-demand variance ratio. Our major findings are that (1) EL use with supplier industries reduces the bullwhip effect, whereas (2), surprisingly, EL use with buyer industries increases it, but (3) this adverse effect tends to be mitigated by IT use. These findings point to the possible asymmetric effects of EL use in supply chains and provide a different perspective to the existing conclusions in the literature that EL use improves performance. Combining the above results, we have learned that the use of EL tends to behave differently depending on whether it is used upstream or downstream in the supply chain.

On the other hand, the Web also exposes customers to a vast amount of <mark>information</mark> about their health policy, claims, and coverage; this <mark>information</mark> can create uncertainty leading to customers seeking more <mark>information</mark> and hence making more telephone calls.

The specifications allow for nonstationarity, and the disturbance process of the model is specified non-parametrically. We consider various scenarios concerning the pattern of missing data points. One estimator we suggest is based on a smaller but complete subset of the sample; another is based on a larger but incomplete subset of the sample. We give large sample results for both of these cases."	gdwmxdj2tr	"Spatial models with spatially lagged dependent variables and incomplete data"
"Although <mark>information</mark> technology hereafter, IT expenditures represent an increasingly large investment for most corporations, firms are not required to disclose them separately in their financial statements. We hypothesize and find evidence that <mark>information</mark> about a firm's IT expenditures helps explain its future performance as reflected in both accounting measures residual income, earnings volatility and market measures stock price and long-run abnormal returns. In particular, we provide evidence of market mispricing and suggest the lack of firm-level annual IT expenditure disclosure as one potential reason for such mispricing. Altogether, the evidence presents a persuasive case that <mark>information</mark> about a firm's IT expenditures is useful to stock market participants. The evidence we report is useful to managers and accounting policy makers contemplating the public disclosure of firm-level <mark>information</mark> about IT investments."	2umbbyzipb	"The Relevance of <mark>Information</mark> Technology Expenditures."
"This study examines the predictive power of self-disclosed social media <mark>information</mark> on borrowers’ default in peer-to-peer (P2P) lending and identifies social deterrence as a new underlying mechanism that explains the predictive power. Using a unique data set that combines loan data from a large P2P lending platform with social media presence data from a popular social media site, borrowers’ self-disclosure of their social media account and their social media activities are shown to predict borrowers’ default probability. Leveraging a social media marketing campaign that increases the credibility of the P2P platform and lenders disclosing loan default <mark>information</mark> on borrowers’ social media accounts as a natural experiment, a difference-in-differences analysis finds a significant decrease in loan default rate and increase in default repayment probability after the event, indicating that borrowers are deterred by potential social stigma. The results suggest that borrowers’ social <mark>information</mark> can be used not only for credit screening but also for default reduction and debt collection."	kquc7eh2on	"Predicting and Deterring Default with Social Media <mark>Information</mark> in Peer-to-Peer Lending."
"This paper uses a new survey data set on manufacturing firms in Cameroon to estimate a Cobb-Douglas production function. Based on a categorization of firms by ownership structure and firms aiming at analysing the constraints surrounding the use of <mark>Information</mark> and Communication Technologies (ICT) as a tool to improving productivity of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SME) in Cameroon, we have evaluated empirically whether to what extent those technologies have contributed to the growth of labour productivity within the firms. Using the <mark>Instrumental</mark> Variables method, to account for the endogeneity problem with cross sectional data, we found a positive and significant impact of ICT-capital on labour productivity in Cameroonian’s firms."	ep2ewfqibz	"ICT for the Development of Labour Productivity in Cameroon"

"One fundamental economic challenge in social gaming is how to monetize players. We address this problem from the lens of social influence. Specifically, we examine how players' paying behaviors in a social game are associated with their pure friends and Simmelian-tie friends. Analyzing a comprehensive social game dataset provided by Tencent.com, we find that the cohesion effect emanating from players' direct connections in the social gaming network exhibits positive impacts on players' willingness to pay. Surprisingly, the cohesion effect of pure friends is found to be significantly stronger than that of Simmelian-tie friends, contrary to the common findings in the literature. These new findings have direct implications for companies tasked with designing social games or gamification <mark>systems</mark> and, more broadly, to help better understand the mechanism behind the microscopic economic behavior of individuals in a virtual economy."	ja3e56mykf	"Social Influence and Monetization of Freemium Social Games."
"We study how consumers decide which tariff plan to choose and whether to churn when their friends churn in the mobile industry. We develop a theoretical model showing conditions under which users remain with their carrier and conditions under which they churn when their friends do. We then use a large and rich anonymized longitudinal panel of call detailed records to characterize the consumers' path to death with unprecedented level of detail. We explore the structure of the network inferred from these data to derive instruments for friends' churn, which is typically endogenous in network settings. This allows us to econometrically identify the effect of peer influence in our setting. On average, we find that each additional friend that churns increases the monthly churn rate by 0.06 percent. The observed monthly churn rate across our dataset is 2.15 percent. We also find that firms introducing the pre-paid tariff plans that charge the same price to call users inside and outside the carrier help retain consumers that would otherwise churn. In our setting, without this tariff plan the monthly churn rate could have been as high as 8.09 percent. We perform a number of robustness checks, in particular to how we define friends in the social graph, and show that our results remain unchanged. Our paper shows that the traditional definition of customer lifetime value underestimates the value of consumers and, in particular, that of consumers with more friends due to the effect of contagious churn and, therefore, managers should actively take into account the structure of the social network when prioritizing whom to target during retention campaigns."	7p4pa3oqhv	"Effect of Friends' Churn on Consumer Behavior in Mobile Networks."
"Health consumers are increasingly participating in consumer-to-consumer (C2C) online health communities (OHCs) to receive health-related support and to provide assistance and support to others. However, questions remain as to how individual OHC participants are affected by the relationships they have established within an OHC and how the content exchanged between OHC participants impacts individual-level health knowledge and attitudes. To address these open questions, we develop a model that integrates participant network position (i.e., structural social capital) in an OHC, informational and emotional support exchange, and downstream individual-level health knowledge and attitudes. Based on a panel dataset collected from nine chronic disease-focused discussion boards within an OHC platform, we find that structural social capital is indeed a significant antecedent to social support exchange within an OHC and, interestingly, that social support provisioning (i.e., proactively aiding others) has a stronger effect than social support receipt on health literacy and health attitude improvement."	5vjv75s7pv	"Fostering Participant Health Knowledge and Attitudes: An Econometric Study of a Chronic Disease-Focused Online Health Community."
"Advanced in the present article is a Two-step procedure designed on the methods of the least squares (LS) and <mark>instrumental</mark> <mark>variable</mark> (IV) techniques for simultaneous estimation of the three unknown parameters L∞, K and t0, which represent the individual growth of fish in the von Bertalanffy growth equation. For the purposes of the present analysis, specific MATLAB-based software has been developed through simulated data sets to test the operational workability of the proposed procedure and pinpoint areas of improvement. The resulting parameter estimates have been analyzed on the basis of consecutive comparison (the initial conditions being the same) between the results delivered by the two-step procedure for simultaneous estimation of L∞, K and t0 and the results obtained via the most commonly employed methods for estimating growth parameters; first, use has been made of the Gulland-and-Holt method for estimating the asymptotic length L∞and the curvature parameter K, followed by the von Bertalanffy method for estimation of t0."	al3khcy3o5	"Two-step Procedure Based on the Least Squares and <mark>Instrumental</mark> <mark>Variable</mark> Methods for Simultaneous Estimation of von Bertalanffy Growth Parameters"
"Our objective in this paper is to assess the values of online user reviews for movies compared with the sales impact of post-release ad spending for movies. We use weekly box-office sales and ad spending data for 304 movies released in the U.S. along with online ratings and user characteristics from a social network site for movies. By exploiting the fixed-effects two-stage <mark>instrumental</mark> <mark>variable</mark> approach to account for movie heterogeneity and simultaneous relationships among user reviews, ad spending and sales, we found that improving the volume and valence of ratings can have the equivalent effect that ad spending can provide."	qf7q6gn6pb	"The Economic Value of Online User Reviews with Ad Spending on Movie Box-Office Sales"
